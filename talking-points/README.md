This directory contains talking points from:

- Open Plans (supportive of the proposal)
- Open New York (supportive of the proposal)
- Paul Graziano (opposed to the proposal)

I received Open Plans and Open New York's talking points from those organizations.

I extracted Paul Graziano's talking points from transcripts from [his presentations on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@paulgraziano7877/). These transcripts are also available in this directory.
