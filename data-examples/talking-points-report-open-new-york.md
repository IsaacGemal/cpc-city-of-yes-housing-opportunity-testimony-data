# Reference Talking Points
```
# Universal Affordability Preference (“UAP”):

- What it is: Extra floor area that a property owner can take advantage of only for permanent affordable housing.
- Points in its favor:
  - New affordable housing would be permanent
  - Both mixed-income and 100% affordable buildings will be able to take advantage of this new zoning - making them more efficient and easier to finance.
  - The only buildings that won't have access to this extra floor area are 100% market rate.
  - Would replace and expand upon other existing “voluntary inclusionary housing” programs, which are complicated and not widespread.
  - Getting deeply affordable housing in new developments is our priority. A little bit denser buildings - and not necessarily even taller buildings - is well worth it to get this new housing.
    -Summary: UAP will be a great step forward in bringing more housing, and especially more affordable housing, to our community.

# Lifting Parking Minimums

- What it is: No longer requiring new housing to include expensive parking spaces if the owners don't think their tenants or buyers want them.
- Points in favor:
  - Allows parking to be right-sized for each development, which will reduce the cost of building new housing.
  - Building parking is incredibly expensive: $67,500 on average - and up to as much as $150,000 per spot.
  - This cost is passed on to renters and owners, many of whom don't want a space.
  - Developers already make their designs sub-optimal (e.g. building 9 units instead of 10, in order to avoid triggering current parking mandates), directly causing reductions in our new supply.
  - The burdensome cost of creating parking renders some new developments - particularly small, inexpensive apartment buildings - completely infeasible.
  - Car-dependency and parking construction contribute greatly to our climate crisis. In New York, transportation makes up 29% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than any other category, and personal car usage is more than half of that.
  - Cities across the country with much weaker public transit systems have already removed parking mandates - NYC needs to catch up.
  - This proposal will not restrict the creation of parking spaces, it simply will not require the construction of parking. There will still be cases where parking will be built based on the needs of the community.
  - For too long we've required construction of garages that encourage tenants to have cars and add to traffic and congestion.
  - And because so many other cities are ahead of New York, we have examples of rents falling where parking mandates have been eliminated. For example, after Minneapolis relaxed parking minimums, rents for studio apartments fell by more than $200 per month.
- Summary: NYC's current parking mandates are outdated, expensive, and unnecessary. The “City of Yes” proposal to get rid of them is a great step forward. It will allow a lot more housing to be built without even changing the size of new buildings.

# Transit-Oriented Development (“TOD”)

- What it is: Allowing small apartment buildings in low-density areas, IF:
  - The property is near a subway or Metro-North / LIRR station;
  - On a relatively large lot (>5,000 sq. feet); and
  - On a corner or a wide street.
- Points in its favor:
  - Apartment buildings near transit is the best kind of new development - it creates sustainable and walkable communities, encourages transit ridership, and reduces the demand for car ownership and associated traffic from driving.
  - Encouraging small apartment buildings in low-density areas is obvious - we used to build buildings like this everywhere in New York City, but restrictive zoning makes them illegal in so many parts of our community.
  - Think of X or Y - should these buildings be illegal? Of course not.
  - If you can, identify a couple small, older apartment buildings in your community before testifying - 4 or 5 stories, 10-20 apartments (see here for examples).
  - There are examples of these 3, 4, and 5-story buildings in every single neighborhood in New York City. There is nothing out of context or out of scale about these buildings.
  - If we can't build 4-story apartment buildings close to subway stations in New York City, we all might as well give up - this is the most obvious kind of housing that we should be encouraging in NYC.
- Summary: Bringing back small apartments near the train stations in our community is the perfect way of fixing our housing crisis.

# “Town Center” Zoning

- What it is: Allow better, mixed-use buildings on commercial corridors, so underutilized 1-story buildings can be expanded with housing on top.
- Points in its favor:
  - Decades of bad policies have discouraged the development of vibrant, mixed-use commercial strips.
  - Instead, we've encouraged big box stores with huge parking lots and no housing involved.
  - This proposal will support small businesses, by making it easier for customers (and employees!) to live within walking distance of stores and offices - making real, 24/7 communities across the boroughs.
  - Reduces traffic and improves safety.
  - Think of X or Y - should these buildings be illegal? Of course not.
  - If you can, identify a couple older mixed-use buildings in your community before testifying - 4 or 5 stories with a great small business on the ground floor (see here for examples).
  - Our existing small businesses are threatened by decreased foot traffic in their communities. The most important thing for them is to bring in residents who will be a short, walkable distance from their stores.
- Summary: “Town center” zoning will make our commercial corridors [NAME SPECIFIC STREET(S)] stronger and more vibrant, allowing more people to live in a great, walkable community.

# Accessory Dwelling Units (“ADUs”)

- What it is: Allowing 1- and 2-family properties to add a backyard cottage or convert a garage to accommodate a bigger family or earn extra income from an additional rental.
- Points in its favor:
  - Allows homeowners to maximize the value of their property
  - Allows families to live closer to one another by providing “granny flats” for aging relatives
  - Opens up homeownership opportunities by providing a source of revenue to help cover mortgage and property tax payments
  - Allows for the responsible addition of new housing in lower density neighborhoods
- Summary: Cities and states across the country have allowed ADUs with widespread success. It is time for NYC to do the same.

# Office-to-Residential

- What it is: Allow office-to-residential conversions in office buildings built before 1991 across the city.
- Points in its favor:
  - Create more active, vibrant neighborhoods, helping small businesses who have been hurt by reduced office foot traffic.
  - Current rules are arbitrary in terms of where offices can be converted and when the buildings were built.
  - The State included a program in the budget to pay for affordable housing in office-to-residential conversions. The City needs to pass these zoning changes so we can take advantage of these benefits and get new affordable housing in our community.
  - The State just passed a new tax exemption to encourage office-to-residential conversions, which has a strong affordability incentive in it.
- Summary: Simplifying the office conversion rules and allowing new housing across the city where it makes sense is a great step forward.

# Shared Housing (aka “Single-Room Occupancy” [SROs])

- What it is: Bringing back apartments with shared kitchens and bathrooms, so we can have more options for New Yorkers with different needs.
- Points in its favor:
  - NYC (and many other cities) made shared facilities illegal in the 1960s, hoping that it would push out low-income people who could only afford these types of apartments.
  - Obviously that was immoral and stupid - we ended up with a homelessness crisis and rising costs for everyone.
  - This change will fix the bad decisions that NYC and many other cities made in the 1970s, banning SROs unnecessarily and cutting off low-cost housing options for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers.
  - It creates more options, so single people can split up roommate shares in big apartments and free up more 2, 3, and 4-bedroom options for larger families.
  - Building SROs also creates a much needed step between shelter and long-term apartments and creates opportunities to quickly move individuals out of shelters until more permanent long-term housing becomes available.
  - Building a lot of smaller units quickly will help us meet the current demand for and prices will fall.
- Summary: Allowing more options for seniors, students, singles, etc. is the right thing to do and will help address our housing and homelessness crises.

```

### Quotes


> I'm testifying in support of the city of US and especially focused on the removal of the unnecessary and onerous parking mandates, which cost residents and business owners too much money.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the main argument of the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point, emphasizing the unnecessary cost of parking mandates.

> By using the average square footage of a studio apartment about 500 square feet and average cost per square foot, we can estimate an average 500 Square Foot Apartment costs $187,500 to construct. Research estimates that sub grade parking structures required due to the land constraints in New York City can cost up to $150,000 per space.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote provides specific data that supports the reference talking point about the high cost of building parking spaces. The $150,000 per space mentioned in the testimony exactly matches the upper limit mentioned in the talking points.

> For every 1.2 parking spaces constructed today, one unit of housing is lost.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the talking point that parking mandates reduce housing supply, providing a specific ratio of parking spaces to lost housing units.

> Research has shown that parking mandates have the potential to also increase rent by an estimated 17%. In affordable developments requiring one parking spot per unit of housing, raises total development costs by 12.5%, and 2 parking spots raises costs by about 25%.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote provides specific data on how parking mandates increase housing costs, which aligns with the talking point about parking costs being passed on to renters and owners.

> Even worse, despite the fact that low income households own cars at a lower rate than their high income counterparts, they bear the brunt of these additional costs.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While not explicitly mentioned in the reference talking points, this quote supports the overall argument against parking mandates by highlighting their disproportionate impact on low-income households.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a very high alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in the "Lifting Parking Minimums" section. The speaker, Talya Schwartz from Open Plans, provides detailed information and specific examples that directly support the arguments made in the reference talking points about the negative impacts of parking mandates on housing development and affordability.

The testimony focuses almost exclusively on the issues related to parking mandates, which is one of the key components of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal. The speaker's arguments are nearly identical to those presented in the reference talking points, including:

1. The high cost of building parking spaces (up to $150,000 per space)
2. The impact of parking mandates on housing supply (trading parking for apartments)
3. The increase in development costs and rent due to parking requirements
4. The disproportionate impact on affordable housing and low-income households

While the testimony doesn't cover other aspects of the proposal mentioned in the reference talking points (such as Universal Affordability Preference or Transit-Oriented Development), it provides more detailed calculations and specific examples to support the arguments against parking mandates.

The speaker's use of data and specific examples suggests a deep understanding of the issue and aligns closely with the reference talking points' approach to advocating for the removal of parking minimums. This level of detail and alignment indicates that the testimony may have been influenced by or developed in coordination with the organization providing the reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall message of the reference talking points, which emphasize the need for more housing across the city. It aligns with the general theme present in multiple talking points.

> The proposal for universal affordable pre affordability preference promises to significantly increase our affordable housing stock throughout Manhattan with a relatively low income target of 60% AMI.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) mentioned in the talking points. It highlights the potential for increasing affordable housing stock, which is a key aspect of the UAP talking point.

> City of Yes for housing opportunity would also reduce roadblocks for the conversion of vacant and underutilized offices into residential and unlock unlock a projected 6000 units over the next 16 years.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely aligns with the office-to-residential conversion talking point. It mentions the same benefits of creating more housing through office conversions.

> Our current zoning code makes it hard to convert vacant office buildings to residences. It prioritizes construction of parking over apartments.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote touches on two points from the reference talking points: office-to-residential conversions and the issue of parking minimums. While not using identical language, it supports the same arguments presented in the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine is very closely related to the reference talking points. Levine's speech covers several key aspects mentioned in the talking points, including the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP), office-to-residential conversions, and the general need for increased housing supply and affordability across New York City.

The testimony makes identical claims to the reference talking points in some areas, particularly regarding UAP and office conversions. While not all points from the reference talking points are directly addressed (such as ADUs and SROs), the overall message and arguments presented by Levine strongly align with the goals and reasoning outlined in the talking points.

Levine's position as a high-ranking city official adds weight to his testimony, and his support for the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal closely mirrors the advocacy suggested in the reference talking points. The language and arguments used are similar enough to suggest that Levine may be familiar with or influenced by the same ideas presented in the reference talking points.

Given the strong alignment in key areas and the overall supportive stance towards increasing housing supply and affordability, it is plausible that Levine is using ideas similar to the reference talking points in his testimony.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the density bonus for affordable housing, which is very similar to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) mentioned in the reference talking points. Both the testimony and the talking points highlight this as a crucial tool for creating more affordable housing.

> It encourages the creation of mixed income communities, fostering diversity and economic integration.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the idea of mixed-income communities, which is also mentioned in the UAP talking point. While the language is not identical, the concept and its benefits are very similar.

> This and other updates allows us to update our outdated zoning rules to build more housing of every type and to build affordable housing in every neighborhood.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall goal of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity amendment, which aims to update zoning rules to allow for more housing, including affordable housing, in all neighborhoods. While not identical to any specific talking point, it aligns with the general theme of the reference talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony provided by Emily Kurtz on behalf of RiseBoro Community Partnership shows a strong alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in relation to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and the overall goal of creating more affordable housing across New York City.

The testimony directly mentions the density bonus for affordable housing, which is a key component of the UAP talking point. It also emphasizes the creation of mixed-income communities and the need to update zoning rules to allow for more housing of all types in every neighborhood. These points closely align with the reference talking points.

While the testimony doesn't specifically address all aspects of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity amendment (such as lifting parking minimums or office-to-residential conversions), it does express strong support for the amendment as a whole. This suggests that the speaker is likely in favor of these other components as well, even if they are not explicitly mentioned.

The level of similarity between the testimony and the reference talking points is high, particularly in relation to the core concepts of increasing affordable housing and updating zoning rules to achieve this goal. The language used in the testimony, while not identical to the talking points, conveys very similar ideas and arguments.

### Quotes


> I'm particularly excited about the creation of permanent affordable housing through the UIP proposal

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, using similar language about permanent affordable housing.

> as well as the re legalization of new NRSROs

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote likely refers to the Shared Housing (SRO) talking point, although it uses a different acronym. The concept of re-legalizing this type of housing is the same.

> New York needs to grow. It is time to build new housing after decades of stagnation, and the problem will only get worse if we wait any longer.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This sentiment aligns with the overall message of the talking points, which advocate for more housing and growth. While not identical to any specific point, it supports the general pro-housing stance.

> Prices will get higher, neighborhood businesses will struggle, and families will either squeeze into undersized apartments or move away.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote touches on concerns addressed in several talking points, particularly the 'Town Center' zoning point which mentions supporting small businesses and creating walkable communities. It also aligns with the general housing crisis concerns mentioned throughout the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in its support for the "City of Yes" plan and its specific mentions of permanent affordable housing (UAP) and shared housing (SROs). The speaker's overall pro-growth stance and concerns about rising housing costs and neighborhood vitality also align with the general themes of the talking points.

However, the testimony doesn't cover all aspects of the talking points. It doesn't mention specific points like lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or office-to-residential conversions. Despite this, the core message and key elements of the testimony are very closely related to the reference talking points.

The language used, while not identical, often conveys the same ideas and concerns as the talking points. The speaker's affiliation with a pro-housing organization (Open New York) further suggests that they may be familiar with and influenced by these or similar talking points.

Given the strong alignment on key issues and the overall pro-housing message, it is plausible that the speaker is using ideas from the reference talking points in their testimony, even if not quoting them directly.

### Quotes


> I'd like to specifically highlight the universal affordability preference or UAP aspect of City of Yes for housing opportunity, which if adopted should not only result in significantly more units being built, but will also help the groups that are most vulnerable. By adding permanently affordable housing units.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, emphasizing its potential to increase housing units and help vulnerable groups with permanently affordable housing. The language and argument are very similar to the reference talking point.

> Housing experts agree that the fundamental problem is we don't have enough units of housing, so we need to reform our housing rules to allow 100 of 1000 of additional units to be built.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns closely with the overall theme of the reference talking points, which all aim to increase housing supply through various means. While not identical to any single talking point, it supports the general argument present in all of them.

> Every neighborhood must do its part to meet the housing needs of our city, and that is exactly what city of yes for housing is all about. A little more housing in every neighborhood.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the ideas present in several talking points, particularly Transit-Oriented Development and 'Town Center' Zoning, which aim to add housing in various neighborhoods. While not using the same language, it strongly supports the concepts.


### Analysis
The testimony by Luke Lavanway is very closely related to the reference talking points. While he doesn't cover all aspects of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal, his strong support for the plan and specific mention of the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) show a high level of alignment with the reference talking points.

Lavanway's emphasis on the need for more housing units, his support for development in all neighborhoods, and his criticism of those opposing development all closely mirror the themes present in the reference talking points. His mention of the UAP is particularly noteworthy as it directly corresponds to one of the main points in the reference list.

Although he doesn't specifically mention some aspects of the proposal (such as lifting parking minimums or office-to-residential conversions), his overall stance and arguments are very much in line with the reference talking points. In fact, his suggestion that the plan might not go far enough indicates an even stronger pro-development stance than the talking points themselves.

The language and arguments used by Lavanway, while not always identical to the reference points, consistently support the same goals and ideas. This suggests that he is either very familiar with the talking points or has independently arrived at very similar conclusions.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the Lifting Parking Minimums talking point. The speaker's support for this change aligns closely with the arguments presented in the reference talking points.

> Among the most important components of this proposal are the proposed expansion of provisions of Article 1 chapter 5 and other related regulatory changes. These are aligned with the recommendations of the Office Adaptive Reuse Task force and will help facilitate more office to residential conversions.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the Office-to-Residential conversion talking point. While not using identical language, it expresses support for facilitating office-to-residential conversions, which aligns with the reference talking point.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a high degree of alignment with the reference talking points. The speaker, representing the Real Estate Board of New York, expresses support for many of the key initiatives outlined in the talking points, including transit-oriented development, accessory dwelling units, parking requirement changes, office-to-residential conversions, and the Universal Affordability Preference.

The language used in the testimony often closely mirrors the concepts presented in the reference talking points, indicating a strong familiarity with these arguments. The speaker's support for these initiatives is consistent with the arguments presented in the reference talking points, suggesting that they may be drawing from similar sources or perspectives.

However, the testimony also includes some concerns and recommendations not present in the provided talking points, such as the potential negative impacts of eliminating existing inclusionary housing programs and the need for careful implementation. This suggests that while the speaker is largely aligned with the provided talking points, they are also bringing their own additional perspectives and concerns to the discussion.

Overall, the testimony demonstrates a high level of alignment with the reference talking points, while also providing some additional nuance and industry-specific concerns.

### Quotes


> The universal affordability preference paired estate incentive 485x can be a game changer for affordable and supportive housing in New York.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) mentioned in the reference talking points. While it doesn't go into as much detail, it presents the concept as a 'game changer' for affordable housing, which aligns with the positive framing in the reference points.

> The plan before us today allows modest apartment buildings above businesses on Commercial Streets makes needed and common sense office to residential conversions much easier and in high demand areas creates new high density zoning districts, which come with strong affordability requirements.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote encompasses two key points from the reference talking points: the 'Town Center' Zoning concept (allowing apartments above businesses on commercial streets) and the Office-to-Residential conversions. The language and framing are very similar to the reference points, presenting these as common-sense solutions.

> City of US for housing opportunity works towards this in a number of important ways such as allowing for contextual missing middle small apartment buildings near transit

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns closely with the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) concept from the reference talking points. It mentions small apartment buildings near transit, which is a key aspect of TOD as described in the reference document.

> This package will address a decades long imbalance between housing demand and supply. Instead of unchecked costs pushing people out of New York City, we can spur housing growth that will benefit New Yorkers at all income levels and ensure New York remains a livable city and magnet for global talent for generations to come.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't reference a specific talking point, it echoes the overall sentiment and rationale presented in the reference document. It emphasizes the need to address the housing crisis and create more affordable options, which is a recurring theme in the reference talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony is very closely related to the reference talking points, often making the same claims and arguments. The language is similar in many instances, and it is plausible that the person is using the reference talking points in their testimony. 

The testimony covers several key points from the reference document, including:
1. Universal Affordability Preference (UAP)
2. Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)
3. "Town Center" Zoning
4. Office-to-Residential conversions

The overall framing of the issues and the proposed solutions is very similar to the reference talking points. Both emphasize the necessity of these changes to address the housing crisis, create more affordable options, and develop more vibrant, inclusive neighborhoods.

However, it's worth noting that the testimony doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference document. For instance, it doesn't specifically address lifting parking minimums, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), or shared housing/SROs. 

Despite these omissions, the high degree of alignment in the covered topics and the similar language and framing suggest that the testimony is very closely related to the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> I do champion the UAP proposal, which I think will mostly on its own standalone as a zoning thing will mostly benefit the nonprofit housing developers that we work with who are already working really hard to keep their neighborhoods affordable. And when they do develop, they do 100% affordable development. That will really benefit them.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point. The speaker explicitly champions the UAP proposal and mentions its benefits for nonprofit housing developers, which aligns with the reference talking point about UAP benefiting both mixed-income and 100% affordable buildings.

> And lastly, eliminating the parking mandate is incredibly important for encouraging more housing. This aspect should not be watered down. As Mark Ginsburg noted earlier, parking is incredibly expensive from between 75,000 to upwards of a 150,000 for sub grade structured parking. That's comparable to the per unit subsidy or more that HPD currently has on their alert term sheets. They say we build what we value, and I would hope that we value our neighbors more than our cars. People should always come before parking.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly supports the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point. The speaker advocates for eliminating parking mandates, citing the high cost of parking construction, which closely mirrors the reference talking points about the expense of building parking and how it affects housing development.

> The proposal does include a series of minor, very rational, but very impactful changes like small relief on setbacks or alignments, on yards, on building height along wide streets, simplified dormer calculations, and streamlined floor area deductions, all of these things add up incrementally tiny over each zoning lot, but they make it easier to build the available SAR on a site especially very difficult sites without even increasing SAR.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly match any specific talking point, it supports the overall goal of making it easier to build housing through zoning changes. This aligns with the general theme of the reference talking points, which advocate for various zoning changes to increase housing supply.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a high level of alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in two key areas: the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and lifting parking minimums. The speaker, Rachel Simpson, explicitly supports these proposals and provides arguments that closely mirror those in the reference talking points.

On the UAP, Simpson champions the proposal and highlights its benefits for nonprofit housing developers, which aligns with the talking points' emphasis on how UAP will benefit both mixed-income and 100% affordable buildings.

Regarding parking minimums, Simpson's testimony is nearly identical to the reference talking points. She advocates strongly for eliminating parking mandates, citing the high costs of parking construction (mentioning figures very similar to those in the talking points) and arguing that this change is crucial for encouraging more housing development.

While the testimony doesn't cover all aspects of the reference talking points (such as Transit-Oriented Development, Town Center Zoning, ADUs, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Shared Housing), it does touch on additional zoning changes that support the overall goal of increasing housing supply. This shows a general alignment with the broader themes of the talking points, even if not all specific proposals are mentioned.

The language and arguments used, particularly regarding parking minimums, are so similar to the reference talking points that it's plausible the speaker was familiar with or influenced by these points. However, as an architect in affordable housing, she may also have independently arrived at similar conclusions based on her professional experience.

Overall, while the testimony doesn't cover the full breadth of the reference talking points, the strong alignment on key issues and the overall supportive stance towards zoning changes to increase housing supply indicate a high level of alignment with the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> Lifting parking mandates will not ban parking from being created. It simply allows parking to be built where it's appropriate, and evidence from other cities that are significantly less robust transit networks and ours shows that parking is still built where it's demanded.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly mirrors the point in the reference talking points that states 'This proposal will not restrict the creation of parking spaces, it simply will not require the construction of parking. There will still be cases where parking will be built based on the needs of the community.' The language and argument are nearly identical.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the reference talking point that states 'Cities across the country with much weaker public transit systems have already removed parking mandates - NYC needs to catch up.' While the specific cities mentioned are different, the argument is the same.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports several points in the reference talking points about the cost of parking and its impact on housing supply. While not using the exact same language, it conveys the same idea that parking mandates increase costs and reduce the number of housing units that can be built.


### Analysis
The testimony given by Michael Sutherland is very closely related to the reference talking points, particularly those concerning the lifting of parking mandates. The speaker makes several identical claims and arguments found in the reference talking points, often using similar language and reasoning. 

The testimony focuses exclusively on the parking mandate reform aspect of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, which is one of the key points in the reference talking points. The speaker's arguments align closely with those provided in the reference document, including the idea that lifting mandates won't ban parking but allow it to be built where appropriate, citing examples of other cities that have implemented similar reforms, and discussing the potential benefits in terms of increased housing supply and reduced costs.

While the testimony doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference document about parking mandates (such as specific cost figures or the environmental impact), it does make several identical arguments and uses very similar reasoning. The language and structure of some arguments are remarkably similar to those in the reference talking points, suggesting a high degree of alignment.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While not identical to any specific talking point, this quote supports the general theme of increasing housing options across the city, which is present in several of the reference talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in relation to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and lifting parking minimums. The speaker, Mark Ginsberg, presents arguments that are very similar to those in the reference talking points, often making the same claims and using similar reasoning.

The testimony focuses mainly on two aspects of the proposed changes: UAP and parking requirements. For these topics, the alignment is very high, with the speaker using almost identical arguments to those provided in the reference talking points. This suggests that the speaker may be directly referencing or influenced by these talking points.

While the testimony doesn't explicitly cover all the points mentioned in the reference document (such as Transit-Oriented Development, Town Center Zoning, ADUs, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Shared Housing), the overall support for the amendments and the emphasis on increasing housing options aligns with the general goals mentioned in the reference talking points.

- **Analysis:** This quote aligns closely with the reference talking point that states 'For too long we've required construction of garages that encourage tenants to have cars and add to traffic and congestion.' It makes the same argument using slightly different wording.

> Developers are explicitly saying they will build parking even when it is not required.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the reference talking point that states 'This proposal will not restrict the creation of parking spaces, it simply will not require the construction of parking. There will still be cases where parking will be built based on the needs of the community.' It provides evidence for this claim.


### Analysis
The testimony is very closely related to the reference talking points, particularly those concerning the lifting of parking minimums. The speaker, Jackson Chabot, makes several arguments that are either identical to or strongly support the provided talking points. He emphasizes the outdated nature of parking mandates, their contribution to climate change, and how they encourage car ownership and usage. These points directly align with the reference talking points.

Moreover, Chabot provides additional context and examples that reinforce the arguments made in the talking points, such as mentioning developers who plan to build parking even when not required. This supports the talking point that the proposal will not restrict parking creation where needed.

While the testimony focuses primarily on parking issues and doesn't address other aspects of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal (such as Universal Affordability Preference or Transit-Oriented Development), the alignment on the parking issue is very strong.

Given the high degree of similarity in arguments and language used, it is plausible that the speaker is using the reference talking points in their testimony, at least for the sections related to parking minimums.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly mentions several key elements from the talking points, including transit-oriented development, accessory dwelling units, and universal affordability preference. The language is not identical, but the concepts are the same.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly mentions support for office to residential conversions and elimination of parking requirements, which are both key talking points. The language is very similar to the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a high level of alignment with the reference talking points. While the exact language is not identical, the speaker covers many of the same concepts and expresses support for key elements of the City of Yes initiative. The testimony touches on transit-oriented development, accessory dwelling units, universal affordability preference, office to residential conversions, and elimination of parking requirements - all of which are prominent in the reference talking points.

The speaker's overall stance is supportive of the initiative, which aligns with the general tone of the talking points. However, the testimony also includes some additional concerns and suggestions not present in the talking points, such as the need for a more comprehensive approach and ensuring adequate infrastructure.

Despite these additions, the core message and support for the key elements of City of Yes remain consistent with the reference talking points. The testimony appears to be independently formulated but closely aligned with the organization's stance.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote makes an identical argument to the reference talking point on lifting parking minimums. It mentions the increased cost of housing, reduction in housing units, and encouragement of car use, which are all key points in the reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the reference talking point on Transit-Oriented Development. While it doesn't go into as much detail, it aligns with the idea of encouraging housing near transit stations.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly mentions several key components that are identical to the reference talking points, including parking mandates, transit-oriented development, town center zoning, and ADUs.


### Analysis
The testimony is very closely related to the reference talking points, often making the exact same claims and arguments. The language used is similar in many cases, particularly when discussing parking mandates and transit-oriented development. The testimony covers most of the main points from the reference talking points, including parking mandates, transit-oriented development, town center zoning, and accessory dwelling units. 

While the testimony doesn't cover every single point from the reference talking points (such as Universal Affordability Preference or Shared Housing/SROs), it does align closely with the overall message and supports the same zoning changes. The testimony also adds some environmental arguments that are not extensively covered in the reference talking points, but these additions are consistent with the overall pro-zoning change stance.

Given the high degree of similarity in both content and language, it is plausible that the person giving the testimony is using the reference talking points or a similar set of talking points in their testimony.

- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the 'Office-to-Residential' talking point. While it's more general and doesn't specify office buildings, it supports the same concept of converting non-residential buildings to housing.


### Analysis
The testimony is very closely related to the reference talking points, often making the same claims and arguments. The speaker, Emily Klein from Community Preservation Corporation, explicitly supports the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal and covers almost all of the main points mentioned in the reference talking points.

The testimony uses similar language and arguments for several key points, including Universal Affordability Preference (UAP), lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), "Town Center" zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), and office-to-residential conversions. In some cases, the testimony uses nearly identical language to the reference talking points.

While the testimony doesn't go into as much detail on each point as the reference talking points do, it presents a comprehensive overview that aligns very closely with the provided talking points.

### Analysis
The testimony is very closely related to the reference talking points. The speaker explicitly mentions and supports three key aspects of the proposal: Transit-Oriented Development, Universal Affordability Preference, and Office-to-Residential conversions. These are directly aligned with the reference talking points.

The overall message of the testimony strongly supports the need for increasing housing supply and addressing the housing crisis, which is a central theme in the reference talking points. The speaker's emphasis on "missing middle housing" aligns with the goals of several talking points, even if not explicitly mentioned in the reference document.

The union's perspective adds weight to the argument that these changes are necessary to address the housing crisis affecting working New Yorkers.

The testimony doesn't mention some specific aspects of the proposal, such as lifting parking minimums, ADUs, or shared housing. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate disagreement with these points; rather, it seems the testimony focused on broader support for the proposal as a whole.

> I especially wanna focus on the provisions to allow shared housing and SROs or single room occupancy units. I understand apartments with shared kitchens and bathrooms aren't for everyone. But this kind of housing can be a real boom for people just starting out.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the 'Shared Housing (aka 'Single-Room Occupancy' [SROs])' talking point. The speaker is explicitly supporting the reintroduction of SROs, which aligns perfectly with the reference talking point that advocates for bringing back apartments with shared kitchens and bathrooms.

> In the sixties, we made SROs illegal. Because we thought it would push out the low income people who lived in those types of apartments that didn't work. It was immoral and dumb, and we ended up with a homeless critics and rising costs for everyone.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely mirrors the historical context provided in the reference talking point about SROs. It mentions the same timeframe (1960s) and criticizes the decision to make SROs illegal, just as the reference point does. The speaker also draws the same conclusion about the negative impacts on homelessness and housing costs.

### Analysis
The testimony is very closely related to the reference talking points, particularly on the topic of Shared Housing/SROs. The speaker makes almost identical arguments to those presented in the reference talking points, including the historical context of banning SROs in the 1960s and the negative consequences that followed. She also emphasizes the importance of affordable housing options for artists and creative professionals, which aligns with the overall theme of affordability present in many of the reference talking points.

While the speaker doesn't explicitly mention all aspects of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity initiative covered in the reference talking points, her strong support for the initiative implies agreement with its various components. The language and arguments used, especially regarding SROs, are very similar to those in the reference talking points, suggesting that the speaker may be familiar with or influenced by these talking points.

Given the strong alignment on the SRO topic and the overall support for the initiative, it is plausible that the person is using the reference talking points in their testimony, at least in part.

### Analysis
The testimony by Austin Celestin shows a high level of alignment with the reference talking points. While he doesn't cover every single point mentioned in the reference document, his overall message and the specific points he does mention are very closely related to the key themes and arguments presented in the talking points.

Celestin's testimony focuses on the urgent need for more housing in New York City, which is the underlying theme of all the reference talking points. He explicitly mentions and supports several key aspects of the proposal that are directly addressed in the talking points, such as lifting parking mandates, transit-oriented development, and commercial-to-residential conversions.

His support for the proposal's varied approach to different neighborhood needs aligns with the nuanced strategies outlined in the talking points, such as the "Town Center" zoning and Transit-Oriented Development. While he doesn't use the exact terminology from the talking points, the concepts he supports are the same.

The testimony doesn't explicitly mention some aspects like the Universal Affordability Preference or Accessory Dwelling Units, but his overall enthusiastic support for the proposal and his emphasis on the need for more affordable housing suggest that he would likely be in favor of these aspects as well.

Celestin's personal anecdotes about the difficulty of affording housing in the city and his mention of record low vacancies and high rents reinforce the urgency expressed in the talking points about the need for comprehensive zoning reform.

In conclusion, while the testimony doesn't cover every single point in the reference document, it strongly supports the overall message and many of the key arguments, showing a high level of alignment with the reference talking points.

The testimony shows a high level of alignment with the reference talking points, particularly focusing on Transit-Oriented Development and Lifting Parking Minimums. The speaker's arguments and examples closely mirror those provided in the reference talking points, using similar language and emphasizing the same benefits and drawbacks. The testimony strongly supports the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal, which is in line with the overall message of the reference talking points.

It primarily focuses on two key areas, while other topics such as Universal Affordability Preference, "Town Center" Zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, Office-to-Residential conversions, and Shared Housing are not addressed.

Despite this limited scope, the depth and specificity with which the speaker addresses Transit-Oriented Development and Lifting Parking Minimums suggest a very close alignment with these particular talking points.

The testimony by Elizabeth Denys is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly on the topics of Transit-Oriented Development, Lifting Parking Minimums, and Accessory Dwelling Units. She uses similar arguments and language to support these aspects of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" initiative.

However, the testimony doesn't cover all aspects of the reference talking points. It doesn't mention Universal Affordability Preference, "Town Center" Zoning, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Shared Housing. This suggests that while the testimony is strongly aligned with the talking points it does cover, it's not a comprehensive representation of all the reference talking points.

The speaker's affiliation with Open New York, a pro-housing organization, likely contributes to the alignment between her testimony and the reference talking points. Her personal experiences and concerns about housing in NYC also reinforce the arguments made in the talking points.

Overall, while the testimony doesn't cover all aspects of the reference talking points, it strongly supports and closely aligns with the points it does address, using similar language and arguments.

### Quotes


> First, we strongly support the initiative to eliminate parking requirements. These onerous mandates have impeded the creation of housing across large expanses of the city for decades adding tremendous cost to new housing development and in many cases compelling developers to build fewer units and zoning allows in order to avoid triggering expensive parking requirements.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the reference talking point on 'Lifting Parking Minimums'. It mirrors the arguments about parking requirements being expensive and impeding housing development.

> Ending parking mandates is not banned parking, far from it. Developers will build parking where there's demand for it, but zoning won't force its inclusion where it isn't warranted.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely aligns with the reference talking point that states 'This proposal will not restrict the creation of parking spaces, it simply will not require the construction of parking.'

> We also strongly support the expansion of transit oriented development including growing the footprint of transit zones across the city as well as the town center zoning initiative.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports both the 'Transit-Oriented Development' and 'Town Center Zoning' talking points, showing alignment with multiple aspects of the reference talking points.

> Increasing density around transit, whether that be subway and commuter rail stations, select service routes or the future path of the inner borough express and walkable and vikable neighborhoods is a crucial policy for combating climate change as well as burning housing creation and will make it much easier for New Yorkers to avoid the tremendous financial burden of car ownership should they so choose.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the ideas presented in both the 'Transit-Oriented Development' and 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking points, emphasizing benefits like combating climate change and reducing car ownership.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a high alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in relation to eliminating parking requirements and supporting transit-oriented development. The speaker makes very similar arguments to those presented in the reference talking points, often using comparable language and emphasizing the same benefits. The testimony focuses on a subset of the overall talking points, but where it does address them, it shows strong alignment.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the UAP talking point, mentioning both mixed-income and 100% affordable housing, as well as permanent affordability. It's nearly identical to the reference talking point.

> The city of yes will help generate obsolete office buildings.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the office-to-residential conversion talking point, although it's not as detailed as the reference. It shows alignment with the idea of repurposing office buildings.

> Although parking is required in many neighborhoods, it is also a marketability question and decision. To mandate parking in areas that may need may not need it. Just only adds more cost anywhere from 50 to 75,000 per unit because of the inclusion of parking, making the construction of affordable housing cheaper, they're more efficient, and more obtainable.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly supports the lifting parking minimums talking point. It mentions the high cost of parking and how it affects affordability, which is very similar to the reference talking point.

> Town centers, we cannot get our way of out of a housing crisis with only the construction of mega projects. Unit by unit, we get ourselves out of a housing crisis.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the 'Town Center' zoning talking point, emphasizing the importance of smaller-scale development in addressing the housing crisis. While not as detailed as the reference, it aligns with the core idea.

> With that said, I know there's a lot more details relating to the legislation. But perfect is the enemy of God or a city of creativity, a city of production, and an inclusive city where mixed income housing is the way we're gonna keep our missing middle in our city and not for moving out.

- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall theme of the talking points, emphasizing the need for mixed-income housing and addressing the 'missing middle'. It aligns with the general spirit of the legislation as presented in the talking points.


### Analysis

While the exact language is not identical, the speaker covers many of the key points mentioned in the reference talking points, particularly regarding UAP, parking minimums, office-to-residential conversions, and the overall need for increased housing supply. The testimony strongly supports the legislation and uses similar reasoning to justify its importance. It is highly plausible that the person is using the reference talking points as a basis for their testimony, even if not directly quoting them.

### Quotes


> Transit oriented development is a no brainer approach to leveraging our amazing transit system and removal of parking minimums is sorely needed in order to reduce unit costs and help shift mode share away from cars.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses two key talking points: Transit-Oriented Development and Lifting Parking Minimums. It uses similar language and reasoning to the reference talking points, mentioning cost reduction and shift away from cars.

> I'm particularly concerned about climate change impacts facing our sorry. Facing our coastal city New Yorkers have one third the greenhouse gas footprint of the national average, and more housing means more New Yorkers means less greenhouse gas emissions.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the environmental benefits mentioned in the Lifting Parking Minimums and Transit-Oriented Development talking points. While it doesn't use identical language, it supports the same argument about reduced emissions.

> I speak not only on behalf of myself, but for multiple friends who have had to leave the city due to our housing costs. And personally, I'm concerned over my ability to stay in the city long term and start a family here despite my desire to never leave.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly reference a specific talking point, it supports the overall theme of the need for more affordable housing options, which is a key driver behind many of the proposed changes in the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with several key aspects of the reference talking points, particularly those related to parking minimums and transit-oriented development. The speaker, Daniel Fischer, explicitly supports the removal of parking minimums and transit-oriented development, using language and arguments very similar to those in the reference talking points.

Fischer's testimony also touches on themes of housing affordability and environmental concerns, which are central to many of the talking points. His mention of friends leaving the city due to housing costs and his own concerns about long-term affordability align with the overall goals of the proposed changes, even if he doesn't specifically mention all the individual proposals.

The speaker's emphasis on climate change and the lower greenhouse gas footprint of New Yorkers supports the environmental arguments made in several of the talking points, particularly those related to reducing car dependency.

While the testimony doesn't cover all the specific proposals mentioned in the talking points (such as Universal Affordability Preference, "Town Center" Zoning, ADUs, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Shared Housing), the overall sentiment and the specific points mentioned show a high level of alignment with the goals and reasoning behind the "City of Yes" proposal.

Given the strong alignment on key points and the overall supportive stance towards the proposal, this testimony can be classified as having a high alignment with the reference talking points.

The testimony shows a high level of alignment with the reference talking points. The speaker explicitly supports the "City of Yes" proposal and mentions several specific policies that are outlined in the talking points, such as ADUs, SROs, UAP, and transit-oriented development. The testimony also echoes the talking points' emphasis on the relationship between housing supply and rent prices, using similar arguments about how increasing housing supply can help reduce rents.

### Analysis
The testimony shows a high level of alignment with the reference talking points. While it doesn't go into specific details about each point, it touches on several key aspects of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal. The speaker expresses strong support for the entire package of reforms, emphasizing the balance between bold action and thoughtful policy solutions.

The testimony directly addresses or alludes to five of the seven main talking points: Town Center Zoning, Office-to-Residential conversions, Accessory Dwelling Units, Shared Housing (SROs), and Universal Affordability Preference. The language used in the testimony often mirrors or closely aligns with the language in the reference talking points, indicating a high degree of similarity in messaging and goals.

It's worth noting that the testimony doesn't explicitly mention Transit-Oriented Development or Lifting Parking Minimums. However, this omission doesn't necessarily indicate disagreement with these points; rather, it may be due to time constraints or a focus on other aspects of the proposal.

Overall, the testimony presents a cohesive argument in favor of the "City of Yes" proposal that aligns closely with the provided reference talking points, both in terms of specific policy recommendations and overarching goals.

### Quotes


> I would encourage the commission to not exempt some communities from playing their part, not pull out EDUs, not pull out the parking, not pull out UAP, because that will undermine the credibility and I think the approach of having everybody contribute a little bit.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references three key elements from the talking points: ADUs (referred to as EDUs), parking minimums, and Universal Affordability Preference (UAP). The speaker is advocating for including these elements in the proposal, which aligns closely with the reference talking points.

> And in those years, I have seen up close and personal the way the current zoning resolution restricts housing production.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This statement supports the general theme present in many of the talking points about how current zoning laws restrict housing production. While not identical to any specific talking point, it supports the overall argument for zoning changes.

### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with the reference talking points. While it doesn't delve into the same level of detail as the talking points, it clearly supports the same overall goals and mentions several specific proposals by name.

The speaker, John Woelfling, explicitly endorses the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal and argues against exempting any communities from the changes. This aligns with the comprehensive approach suggested in the talking points.

Woelfling directly mentions three key elements from the talking points: ADUs (referred to as EDUs), parking minimums, and Universal Affordability Preference (UAP). His advocacy for including these elements in the proposal shows a high degree of alignment with the reference talking points.

The testimony also supports the general themes present in the talking points, such as the need to address restrictive zoning laws, increase housing production, and provide more housing options for families in need. The personal anecdote about seeing a family living in a tent reinforces the urgency of the housing crisis, which is an underlying theme in the talking points.

While the testimony doesn't cover all the specific points mentioned in the reference document, the ones it does mention are closely aligned, and the overall message is very supportive of the proposed changes.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the issue of parking minimums, which is a key point in the reference talking points. The speaker argues for their removal, aligning closely with the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote elaborates on the benefits of removing parking minimums, mentioning environmental benefits and the potential for more affordable housing. This aligns closely with several points in the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' section of the reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall goal of increasing housing supply to address homelessness. While not directly referencing a specific talking point, it aligns with the general theme of the City of Yes proposal to increase housing availability.

### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with several key talking points from the City of Yes proposal, particularly in relation to ADUs, reduced parking requirements, and the benefits of walkable, transit-oriented communities. The speaker, Monil Javeri, provides personal anecdotes and arguments that directly support these aspects of the proposal.

The most significant alignment is with the ADU talking point, where Javeri's desire to care for his aging parents while maintaining some separation perfectly illustrates the benefits of ADUs mentioned in the reference talking points.

Javeri's comments on walkability and the benefits of living in a less car-dependent area strongly support the arguments for lifting parking minimums and encouraging transit-oriented development. While he doesn't use the exact terminology from the talking points, his personal experiences effectively communicate the advantages of these proposed changes.

The testimony also touches on the broader goals of the City of Yes proposal, such as increasing housing supply to address homelessness and building stronger communities. These points, while not always directly referencing specific talking points, align with the overall vision of the proposal.

However, it's worth noting that the testimony does not cover all aspects of the City of Yes proposal. There's no mention of the Universal Affordability Preference, "Town Center" zoning, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing (SROs). Despite this, the strong alignment with several key talking points and the overall enthusiasm for the proposal indicate a high level of support for the City of Yes initiative.

### Quotes


> So I really wanted to express my support for the city as housing proposal.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote shows general support for the City of Yes housing proposal, which encompasses many of the talking points provided. However, it doesn't refer to any specific point, so the connection is tenuous.

> And, of course, I'd like to support eliminating parking mandate city wide.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point. The speaker explicitly endorses eliminating parking mandates, which is identical to the reference talking point.

> Lower Manhattan currently doesn't have these mandates, but as our city continues to grow, We need to get rid of these outdated policies that create and and create more affordable housing in all neighborhoods.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the argument for lifting parking minimums and relates to creating more affordable housing. It aligns closely with the talking points about parking mandates being outdated and unnecessary, and how removing them can lead to more housing.

> And also wanted to highlight that by eliminating parking mandates, it's just making parking these requirements. I mean, It's just making parking optional. So developers will most definitely continue to build create parking. It's just making it optional.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses a point made in the reference talking points about parking mandates. It echoes the idea that the proposal will not restrict the creation of parking spaces, but simply won't require them, which is almost identical to the reference point.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a moderate level of alignment with the reference talking points, particularly focusing on the elimination of parking mandates. The speaker, Emily Chingay, expresses clear support for the City of Yes housing proposal and specifically endorses the removal of parking mandates citywide. Her arguments closely mirror some of the key points provided in the reference talking points about parking minimums.

However, the testimony does not cover the breadth of topics mentioned in the reference talking points. It doesn't discuss other aspects like Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" Zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Shared Housing. The focus is primarily on the parking mandate issue and a general support for the housing proposal to address affordability concerns.

While the alignment on the parking mandate issue is strong, the overall testimony doesn't demonstrate a comprehensive use of the provided talking points. It seems more like a personal perspective that happens to align with some of the key arguments rather than a coordinated use of the full set of talking points.

> The city of YET's proposal offers a much needed solution by increasing the supply of housing, particularly next income housing, we can create a more inclusive city that benefits everyone.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general idea of increasing housing supply and affordability, which is a theme present in many of the reference talking points. However, it doesn't use the specific language or details from any particular talking point.

> More housing options, including those debts, like, needed as affordable, will drive down overall housing costs, making us to be more accessible to teachers, nurses, firefighters, sanitation workers, and the countless others who keep New York City running

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, which emphasizes the importance of affordable housing. While it doesn't use the exact terminology, it supports the same general idea.

> I appreciate the community input and the contact sensitive planning that have gone to this process. Immunity and contact sensitive plan are essential. We can create new housing opportunity while preserving the unique character of our neighborhoods.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote somewhat relates to the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point, which mentions that there's nothing out of context about small apartment buildings in NYC neighborhoods. The speaker's emphasis on preserving neighborhood character while creating new housing opportunities aligns with this idea, though not explicitly.


### Analysis
The testimony shows support for the City of Yes proposal and emphasizes the need for increased housing supply and affordability in NYC. While it aligns with the overall goals mentioned in the reference talking points, it doesn't use specific terminology or detailed arguments from those points. The speaker focuses more on the general benefits of the proposal, such as economic growth, talent retention, and community diversity, rather than discussing specific zoning changes or technical aspects of the plan.

The testimony does touch on some themes present in the reference talking points, particularly around affordability and the need for context-sensitive planning. However, it lacks the specific examples and detailed arguments provided in the reference talking points.

Overall, while the testimony supports the same general direction as the reference talking points, it doesn't appear to be directly based on or closely following the provided talking points. The language and focus are different, suggesting that the speaker may have developed their arguments independently or based on other sources of information about the City of Yes proposal.

> We will continue to work in order to address the housing crisis by providing more safe, sustainable neighborhood assets.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general idea of addressing the housing crisis, which is a common theme across all talking points. However, it doesn't specifically align with any particular proposal.


### Analysis
The testimony from Francesca Brown, representing CAMBA Housing Ventures, shows general support for the "City of Yes" initiative and its goal of addressing the housing crisis in New York City. However, the testimony lacks specific references to the detailed proposals outlined in the reference talking points.

The speaker expresses support for expanding housing opportunities, particularly for vulnerable New Yorkers, and creating equitable and inclusive communities. This aligns with the overall goals of the "City of Yes" initiative and particularly resonates with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, although UAP is not explicitly mentioned.

While the testimony is supportive of the initiative, it does not delve into specific proposals such as lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, office-to-residential conversions, or Shared Housing. The speaker focuses more on their organization's commitment to addressing the housing crisis rather than advocating for particular policy changes.

Given this analysis, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points in a broad sense, but not showing high alignment with the specific proposals outlined in the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> New York City should do no less. New York's faith community stands ready to do our part, but we need New York zoning rules to enable us to do so.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general theme of the talking points about changing zoning rules to enable more housing development. While it doesn't mention a specific policy, it aligns with the overall goal of the 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' proposal.

> City of yes, for for housing opportunities and enabling housing for many income levels, will mean that more of the lowest income New Yorkers will have greater opportunity to rebuild their lives and give back to our great city.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the 'City of Yes' proposal and emphasizes housing for various income levels, particularly low-income residents. This aligns closely with the UAP talking point about creating more affordable housing.

> US New Yorkers must seize this moment to act and act boldly

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While not using the same language, this sentiment echoes the overall tone of the talking points, which emphasize the need for significant changes to address the housing crisis.


### Analysis
The testimony is generally supportive of the 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' proposal and aligns with the overall goals presented in the reference talking points. While the speaker doesn't delve into specific policy details or use the same language as the talking points, there is a clear emphasis on the need for bold action to address the housing crisis, particularly for low-income residents.

The testimony frames the issue from a faith-based perspective, adding a moral imperative to act that isn't present in the talking points but supports their overall aims. The speaker's call for zoning changes to enable faith communities to contribute to solving the housing crisis aligns with the general thrust of the talking points, even if specific policies aren't mentioned.

The testimony's emphasis on housing for many income levels, particularly for the lowest-income New Yorkers, resonates with the UAP talking point about creating more affordable housing. However, the testimony doesn't go into the level of detail found in the talking points about specific policies like lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or office-to-residential conversions.

Overall, while the testimony doesn't make the exact same claims as the talking points, it strongly supports their general direction and the need for significant change in housing policy. The alignment is clear, even if the specific language and policy details differ.

### Quotes


> I'm here in support of City of Yes.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall stance of the reference talking points, which all fall under the 'City of Yes' proposal. However, it doesn't mention any specific talking points.

> I am urging this planning counsel to consider these things that I think there's a lot more that can be built in, there's a lot more that needs to be done, especially when it concerns both in increasing affordable housing, which is an absolute necessity.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns closely with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, which emphasizes the importance of creating more affordable housing. While it doesn't mention the specific policy, it supports the same goal.


### Analysis
The testimony is generally supportive of the "City of Yes" proposal and emphasizes the need for increasing affordable housing, which aligns with the overall goals of the reference talking points. However, the testimony focuses more on the historical context of discriminatory housing policies and the need to address these issues, rather than discussing specific policy proposals mentioned in the talking points.

The speaker provides a strong rationale for why housing reform is necessary, which complements the more detailed policy proposals in the reference talking points. While the testimony doesn't directly mention or discuss most of the specific policies (such as lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or accessory dwelling units), it does emphasize the importance of increasing affordable housing and addressing exclusionary practices, which are themes present in the reference talking points.

The testimony supports the general direction of the "City of Yes" proposal but doesn't closely mirror the language or specific policy points of the reference talking points. It provides a broader historical and social justice context for the need for housing reform, which can be seen as supporting the overall goals of the talking points without directly referencing them.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote shows general support for the City of Yes proposal, but with some reservations. It doesn't directly align with any specific talking point, but indicates openness to the overall initiative.

> We need to build homes for existing and new New Yorkers for renters and for owners for our children, adults, and seniors for everybody.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the general sentiment of the reference talking points, which aim to increase housing options for various groups. However, it doesn't match any specific talking point exactly.

> I am in support of eliminating or reducing the 680 square foot dwelling unit factor. I have personally lived in units that are 250 square feet and 550 square feet for over 15 years in New York with my partner. It can be done.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly supports the Shared Housing (SRO) talking point, which advocates for allowing smaller living spaces and shared facilities. The speaker's personal experience adds weight to this support.

> I do not find that it does enough to require the creation of truly affordable housing specifically,

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, but expresses concern that the proposal doesn't go far enough in creating affordable housing. It shows partial alignment with the UAP goal but suggests that more should be done.


### Analysis
The testimony shows partial alignment with some of the reference talking points, particularly in relation to the need for more housing options and support for smaller living spaces. However, the speaker focuses more on infrastructure concerns and affordable housing issues that are not fully addressed in the reference talking points. While there is some overlap in goals, the specific approaches and emphasis differ between the testimony and the provided talking points.

> All sites, offices, and commercial property should be converted to emergency residential at accommodation, our tourist visitor accommodation within 30 days of becoming vacant, with allowances of up to 90 days for refurbishment in a 15 year period.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the idea of office-to-residential conversion, which is one of the reference talking points. However, the testimony proposes a more aggressive timeline and includes all commercial properties, not just offices. It also adds the option of tourist accommodation, which isn't mentioned in the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony is somewhat related to the reference talking points, but it focuses on a specific aspect (vacant properties) and proposes measures that are not explicitly mentioned in the talking points. While there is some overlap with the Office-to-Residential conversion point, the testimony goes beyond this and doesn't address most of the other key points in the reference talking points. The speaker supports the overall goal of increasing housing availability but approaches it from a different angle than the provided talking points.

### Quotes


> For a city with the best world class public transit in the whole country. It's ridiculous that we have any provisions to require parking in the first place.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the talking point about lifting parking minimums. It uses similar reasoning, highlighting the strength of NYC's public transit system as a justification for removing parking requirements.

> Parking is not free, and it is a form of subsidy provided to those to less than half of all households in this city that drive. That cost is passed on to renters and owners who may not need the space.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely mirrors the reference talking point about the cost of parking being passed on to renters and owners. It makes the same argument using similar language.

> Not to mention that there's location and reducing carb dependency is our city's best strategy to reduce our carbon footprint and to fight climate change.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the reference talking point about car dependency and parking construction contributing to the climate crisis. While it doesn't provide the same level of detail, it makes the same core argument.

> Removing parking minimums doesn't mean the city doesn't allow parking spaces to be built, as much as I wish that was true. It just allows the market to figure out how much parking is actually needed.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the reference talking point that the proposal will not restrict the creation of parking spaces, but simply won't require them. It emphasizes market-based decision-making for parking.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly in its strong support for lifting parking minimums. The speaker's arguments about parking requirements are very similar to those provided in the reference talking points, often making the same claims and using similar reasoning. 

However, the testimony focuses almost exclusively on the parking minimum aspect of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" initiative and does not address other elements mentioned in the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" Zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Shared Housing.

While the alignment on the parking minimum issue is very high, the overall testimony doesn't cover the full breadth of the reference talking points. Nevertheless, it strongly supports the general goal of increasing housing supply, which is a central theme in the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> This proposal embodies approaches to facilitate the development of housing, which remains really an existential issue for our city. We are in a critical need of significantly more housing supply.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall goal of the 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' proposal, which is to increase housing supply. It aligns with the general sentiment expressed in multiple talking points.

> And this proposal moves boldly forward in allowing for growth through establishing new zoning districts that will permit greater density where appropriate, expanding opportunities for office to residential conversion, eliminating costly parking requirements and providing for affordable housing in many additional neighborhoods through universal affordability preference among other changes.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly mentions several key points from the reference talking points, including increasing density, office-to-residential conversion, eliminating parking requirements, and universal affordability preference. The language is not identical, but the points are very closely aligned.

> Today, certificates exist in the marketplace, and projects that will generate certificates are planned or are underway. I believe that it's important to provide a significant 15 year vesting period certificates to continue to be generated and an additional 10 years for those certificates to be sold in use.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** While this quote discusses the inclusionary housing certificate program, which is not directly mentioned in the reference talking points, it relates to the broader topic of affordable housing development. However, the specific concern about transitioning away from this program is not addressed in the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a significant alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in supporting the overall goals of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal. The speaker, Anita Laremont, explicitly mentions and supports several key elements of the proposal that are also highlighted in the reference talking points, such as increasing housing supply, allowing greater density, expanding office-to-residential conversions, eliminating parking requirements, and implementing the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) program.

However, the testimony also includes concerns and suggestions that are not present in the reference talking points, particularly regarding the transition away from the current voluntary inclusionary housing and inclusionary housing certificate program. This indicates that while the speaker is generally supportive of the proposal, she has some reservations about specific implementation details.

The level of similarity between the testimony and the reference talking points is high in terms of overall support for the proposal and its main objectives. However, the testimony provides a more nuanced perspective, including potential challenges and suggestions for implementation that are not covered in the reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT

While it doesn't mention specific aspects of the proposal, it aligns with the overall message of the talking points that these changes are necessary to address housing issues.

> New York City has added 275,000 households with only 600,000 units housing. This discrepancy is an acceptable, unsustainable highly intelligent need for city wide action.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote highlights the housing crisis in New York City, which is a central theme in the reference talking points. While it doesn't directly reference a specific talking point, it supports the overall argument for the need for more housing, which is a key aspect of the City of Yes proposal.


### Analysis
The testimony is generally supportive of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal, which aligns with the reference talking points. However, the testimony doesn't go into specifics about the proposal's components like Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, or other specific points mentioned in the reference talking points.

Instead, the testimony focuses on the speaker's personal experiences, professional background in affordable housing, and the general need for addressing the housing crisis in New York City. While this aligns with the overall goal of the proposal and the talking points, it doesn't directly reference or closely mirror the specific arguments provided in the talking points.

The testimony does provide support for the proposal and urges the Commission to vote in favor of it, which is in line with the desired outcome of the talking points. However, the lack of specific policy details or arguments that closely match the provided talking points suggests that while the testimony is supportive, it's not directly derived from or closely aligned with the reference talking points.

> City of Yes for Housing Opportunity is one such tool. Some have questioned whether City of Yes for Housing Opportunity does enough to create a production pipeline for deeply affordable housing. This is an important question for Robin Hood and our partners as we are focused on meeting the needs of the poorest New Yorkers. Robinhood's response is that citywide zoning amendments can only do so much.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote acknowledges the importance of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal in creating affordable housing, which aligns with the overall theme of the reference talking points. However, it also recognizes the limitations of zoning amendments alone, showing a nuanced understanding of the issue.

> Importantly, City of Yeswarehouse will also create opportunities for low income families with rental assistance factors to access newer units in higher in higher opportunity neighborhoods. And should also help reduce the barriers that low income value for holders face searching for apartments.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general idea of increasing housing opportunities for low-income families, which is a theme present in several of the reference talking points. While it doesn't directly mention specific proposals like Transit-Oriented Development or Universal Affordability Preference, it aligns with their goals.

> Robinhood believes City of Yes for Housing is a central component of what should be a regional commitment to significantly increase housing supply.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This statement directly supports the overall goal of increasing housing supply, which is a central theme in the reference talking points. It aligns closely with the general message of the talking points without using identical language.


### Analysis
The testimony from Chloe Sarnoff of the Robin Hood Foundation shows a significant level of support for the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal. While the testimony does not directly reference many of the specific talking points provided, it aligns closely with the overall goals and themes present in the reference material.

The speaker emphasizes the severity of New York City's housing crisis and the need for comprehensive solutions, including increased housing supply and support for tenants. This aligns with the general thrust of the reference talking points, which advocate for various measures to increase housing availability and affordability.

The testimony acknowledges that the proposal alone is not sufficient to solve the affordable housing crisis but considers it an essential component. This nuanced view demonstrates a thoughtful approach to the issue, recognizing both the potential and limitations of the proposed zoning reforms.

While the speaker doesn't mention specific elements like Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, or Transit-Oriented Development, the overall support for the proposal and its potential to create more housing opportunities in various neighborhoods aligns with these concepts.

The testimony also touches on the potential for the proposal to benefit low-income families with rental assistance vouchers, which indirectly supports the goals of creating more affordable housing options and improving access to higher opportunity neighborhoods.

In summary, while the testimony doesn't use identical language or reference specific talking points, it strongly supports the overall goals and themes present in the reference material. The speaker's endorsement of the proposal as a "central component" of efforts to increase housing supply particularly aligns with the reference talking points' emphasis on the importance of these zoning reforms.

> I'm particularly excited about the transit oriented development proposal. Which will make it feasible for New Yorkers to stay within their communities as their housing needs change.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references and supports the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point. The speaker's excitement about TOD aligns with the reference talking point's emphasis on creating sustainable and walkable communities near transit.

> Transit oriented development, in particular small apartment buildings scaled for low density neighborhoods, allows people to remain in their neighborhoods even as their housing needs change.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote further elaborates on the speaker's support for TOD, specifically mentioning small apartment buildings in low-density areas, which is a key point in the reference talking points for TOD.

> City of Yes is a real proposal to address this severe lack of housing across the city.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly reference a specific talking point, it supports the overall goal of the City of Yes initiative to address the housing crisis, which is a theme present in multiple talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in regard to Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). The speaker, Theresa Kaplan, explicitly expresses excitement about the TOD proposal and elaborates on its benefits, which closely mirror the points made in the reference talking points.

While the testimony doesn't cover all aspects of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity initiative mentioned in the reference talking points, it strongly supports the overall goal of increasing housing availability and affordability in New York City. The speaker's personal experience as a renter and her professional perspective as an architect lend credibility to her support for the initiative.

The testimony doesn't directly mention other specific aspects of the initiative such as Universal Affordability Preference, Lifting Parking Minimums, or Shared Housing. However, the speaker's general support for the initiative and her emphasis on addressing the "severe lack of housing across the city" suggest that she would likely be in favor of these other components as well.

Overall, while the testimony focuses primarily on TOD and general housing availability, its strong alignment with these key aspects of the initiative and its overall supportive tone indicate a significant level of agreement with the reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the idea of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and 'Town Center' Zoning in the reference talking points, which aim to allow more housing in various neighborhoods. It highlights the need for more equitable distribution of new housing across the city.

> The city of Yes for Housing Opportunity is a vital step towards addressing these issues by implementing citywide zoning reforms that will allow for more housing to be built across all neighborhoods.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall message of the reference talking points, emphasizing the importance of citywide zoning reforms to increase housing supply. While it doesn't mention specific policies, it aligns with the general goal of the 'City of Yes' proposal.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a moderate level of alignment with the reference talking points. While it strongly supports the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal and emphasizes the need for more affordable housing across all neighborhoods, it does not directly reference many of the specific policy proposals mentioned in the talking points.

The testimony focuses on the overall housing crisis, affordability issues, and the need for zoning reforms to allow more housing construction. This aligns with the general context and goals of the reference talking points. However, the speaker does not mention specific proposals like Universal Affordability Preference (UAP), lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), or Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs).

The testimony does touch on some themes present in the reference talking points, such as the need for more housing in all neighborhoods and addressing exclusionary zoning policies. This indirectly supports ideas like TOD and "Town Center" Zoning, although not explicitly.

The speaker's emphasis on affordable housing and racial equity aligns with the overall goals of the "City of Yes" proposal, but the testimony lacks the detailed policy recommendations found in the reference talking points.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points, but not showing high alignment due to the lack of specific policy mentions and details.

> Additionally, I want to recommend DCP or to expand UAP and identify creative opportunities to deepen levels of affordability.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the UAP (Universal Affordability Preference) mentioned in the talking points and suggests expanding it, which aligns with the overall goal of increasing affordable housing.

> To offer 2 recommendations, perhaps DCP can explore ways to make to add additional as of right market rate units on the condition that that allows for deeper affordability at 50% or 40% AMI.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this specific recommendation is not in the talking points, it aligns with the spirit of the UAP section, which aims to increase affordable housing options.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly in its strong support for the "City of Yes" proposal and its focus on addressing the housing shortage and affordability issues in New York City. The speaker's emphasis on increasing density, transit-oriented development, and expanding affordable housing options aligns well with several key points in the reference document.

However, the testimony does not cover all aspects of the reference talking points. It doesn't mention specific initiatives like lifting parking minimums, office-to-residential conversions, ADUs, or shared housing. Instead, it focuses more on expanding and deepening affordability measures, particularly through the UAP program.

The speaker also introduces some ideas that are not explicitly mentioned in the talking points, such as averaging affordability levels between developments in different neighborhoods and addressing racial equity in zoning decisions. These additions, while not directly from the talking points, are in line with the overall spirit of the "City of Yes" proposal.

Overall, while the testimony doesn't cover all aspects of the reference talking points, it strongly supports the main themes and adds some additional perspectives that align with the overall goals of the proposal.

### Quotes


> In particular, that additional floor area ratio will count towards basements and sellers for buildings located near transit.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly relates to the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point, which discusses allowing small apartment buildings in low-density areas near transit. The testimony supports this idea by mentioning additional floor area ratio for basements and cellars near transit.

> The addition of SAR near transit and the expansion of the Universal affordability preference will create modern housing for current tenants and new housing for new tenants.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly mentions the Universal Affordability Preference, which is one of the main talking points in the reference list. It supports the idea that this preference will lead to the creation of new affordable housing.

> Adding SAR to these buildings will create countless new affordable basement and seller units.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While not directly quoting a specific talking point, this statement aligns with the overall theme of creating more affordable housing options, which is present in several of the reference talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a moderate level of alignment with the reference talking points. While it doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference list, it strongly supports the zoning text amendment and focuses on aspects that align with some of the key talking points, particularly those related to Transit-Oriented Development and the Universal Affordability Preference. The testimony emphasizes the creation of affordable housing and the benefits of additional floor area ratio near transit, which are themes present in the reference talking points. However, the testimony is more focused on the specific concerns of rent-stabilized housing providers and doesn't touch on many of the other points mentioned in the reference list, such as parking minimums, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing.

### Quotes


> One section I'd like to speak in favor of is the universal affordability preference. I think it's a good tool for our neighborhood and for the city since it incrementally adds that extra 20 percent of housing on top of the buildings.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and aligns closely with the talking points. It mentions the extra floor area for affordable housing, which is a key aspect of the UAP as described in the talking points.

> This doesn't radically change the scale of our neighborhoods in my view and it has the 100 percent affordability requirement, which means it benefits the people most burdened by this crisis first.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the UAP talking points by emphasizing that the changes won't drastically alter neighborhood character and mentioning the 100% affordability requirement. While not using identical language, it closely aligns with the spirit of the talking points about UAP.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly in regard to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) section. The speaker directly mentions and supports this aspect of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, using language and arguments that are very similar to those provided in the reference talking points.

The testimony makes the same claims about UAP allowing for extra floor area for affordable housing and emphasizes the 100% affordability requirement, which aligns closely with the talking points. The speaker's mention of not radically changing neighborhood scale is also in line with the talking points' emphasis on "a little bit denser buildings."

However, it's important to note that the testimony focuses solely on the UAP aspect of the proposal and does not address other elements mentioned in the reference talking points, such as lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or office-to-residential conversions. This narrow focus limits the overall alignment with the full set of talking points provided.

Despite this limitation, the high degree of similarity in language and arguments regarding the UAP section suggests that it is plausible the speaker is using the reference talking points, at least for this specific aspect of the proposal.

### Quotes


> HSU endorses the city of yes housing plan in full, which is made to eliminate zoning barriers and eliminate and unlock the ability to create more housing of more units of a portable housing throughout the 5 boroughs.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall goals of the 'City of Yes' plan mentioned in the talking points, particularly the emphasis on eliminating zoning barriers to create more housing.

> The city of Yes Plan will help to address this lag and is projected to support the creation of 150,000 new units of housing across the next 15 years across all five boroughs.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the general goals of increasing housing supply mentioned in various talking points, though it doesn't match any specific point verbatim.

> We acknowledge this, but we also recommend that the administration prioritize resources to facilitate more robust operational affordable housing for very low income and extremely low income households.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, which emphasizes the importance of creating permanent affordable housing, especially for lower-income residents.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a significant level of support for the "City of Yes" housing plan and its goals of increasing affordable housing and addressing the housing crisis in New York City. While the speaker doesn't explicitly mention all the specific elements outlined in the reference talking points (such as lifting parking minimums or transit-oriented development), they do endorse the plan "in full" and emphasize its potential to create a large number of new housing units.

The testimony focuses primarily on the need for affordable housing and addressing homelessness, which aligns with the overall goals of the plan. The speaker's emphasis on prioritizing housing for very low and extremely low-income households resonates with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) mentioned in the talking points.

However, the testimony doesn't go into the same level of detail as the reference talking points regarding specific zoning changes or policy mechanisms. Instead, it provides a broader endorsement of the plan's goals and potential outcomes.

Given these observations, while the testimony strongly supports the "City of Yes" plan, it doesn't exhibit the high level of specific alignment that would indicate direct use of the reference talking points. The speaker seems to be advocating from their organization's perspective, which naturally aligns with many of the plan's goals.

### Quotes


> So I wanna focus on 2 comparison cities that I think we should look to for inspiration. The first is Vancouver. There, climate change is a really important issue as it is here. And day as a result, proves to the extensive transferring into development policies because getting housing built near where trans exists. So people don't need to drive as much or don't even need to own cars is one of the most effective policies to reduce carbon emissions on the whole electricity level.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly supports the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point. While it doesn't use the exact language from the talking points, it emphasizes the importance of building housing near transit to reduce car dependency and carbon emissions, which is a key argument for TOD.

> So I think the fact that we're just looking at, you know, 3 to 5 stories here in New York, that should really be a no brainer. And if anything, I would think for the long term, there should be more pressure to, like, even bigger than that and help more people live sustainable, low carbon, car free lifestyles by building more housing near transit.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the Transit-Oriented Development talking point. It suggests that allowing 3-5 story buildings near transit (which is part of the TOD proposal) is obvious and should potentially go further. This aligns closely with the TOD talking point's emphasis on building small apartment buildings near transit.

> The second parallel I think is Austin, Texas. They've been building about ten times as much housing per capita as New York has. And rents are plummeting. I have friends there who are getting rent decreases, which is kind of unheard of here in New York. Precisely because supply, they've loosened their zoning restrictions, they've allowed more housing to be built.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly match any specific talking point, it supports the overall goal of the 'City of Yes' proposal to increase housing supply and reduce rents. It aligns with the general arguments made in favor of loosening zoning restrictions across various talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows strong support for the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, particularly in relation to transit-oriented development and increasing housing supply. While the speaker doesn't use the exact language from the reference talking points, their arguments align closely with several key points, especially those related to Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and the general goals of increasing housing supply and affordability.

The testimony strongly emphasizes the importance of building housing near transit to reduce carbon emissions and car dependency, which directly supports the TOD talking point. The speaker's comparison to Vancouver's policy of allowing taller buildings near transit stations, and their suggestion that New York's proposal for 3-5 story buildings is a "no-brainer" that could potentially go further, closely aligns with the TOD arguments.

Additionally, the testimony's reference to Austin's success in increasing housing supply and reducing rents by loosening zoning restrictions supports the overall goals of the "City of Yes" proposal, even if it doesn't map directly to a specific talking point.

While the testimony doesn't explicitly mention some of the other talking points (such as Universal Affordability Preference, ADUs, or Office-to-Residential conversions), its general support for increased housing supply and more flexible zoning aligns with the spirit of these proposals.

The speaker's emphasis on climate-friendly housing and sustainable, car-free lifestyles also indirectly supports the "Lifting Parking Minimums" talking point, even though it's not explicitly mentioned.

Overall, while the testimony doesn't use the exact language from the talking points, it strongly supports the general principles behind the "City of Yes" proposal, particularly in relation to transit-oriented development and increasing housing supply.

### Quotes


> Additionally, I want to come out in support of repealing the parking mandates because I believe that will allow more housing again to be built.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point. The speaker's reasoning aligns with the reference point that removing parking mandates will allow for more housing to be built.

> And I'm down in Schibsted Bay. We have a lot of parking lots and a lot of public parking. And some of it sits empty for most of the day. And with that being said, it can be more productive use

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point by providing a personal observation that aligns with the reference point about the inefficiency of mandatory parking spaces.

> And I wanna make sure that we have the missing middle housing going forward and we get rid of parking minimum so that these opportunities are available towards people

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote combines support for 'missing middle housing' (which is related to the 'Transit-Oriented Development' talking point) and removing parking minimums. While not using the exact language, it supports the general idea of creating more diverse housing options.

> You're moving out of your parents' house. You want to get out. Like, you need a small place to stay. If you want some roommates, you can't quite afford to buy your own apartment. The rents are skyrocketing. You want to stay in the neighborhood, but those opportunities are becoming less and less for people.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote, while not directly referencing a specific talking point, supports the general idea of creating more affordable and diverse housing options. It relates loosely to the 'Shared Housing' and 'Transit-Oriented Development' talking points by emphasizing the need for smaller, more affordable housing options.


### Analysis
The testimony shows some alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in supporting the removal of parking mandates and advocating for more diverse housing options. The speaker's personal experiences and observations are used to support these ideas, although they don't use the exact language or cover all the points mentioned in the reference talking points.

The testimony most strongly aligns with the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point, providing direct support and personal observations that match the reference points. There is also some support for ideas related to 'Transit-Oriented Development' and 'Shared Housing', although these are not explicitly named or discussed in detail.

While the testimony doesn't cover all the talking points provided (such as Universal Affordability Preference, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Accessory Dwelling Units), it does support the general theme of creating more housing options and removing barriers to housing development.

The personal narrative style of the testimony makes it less directly aligned with the reference talking points, but the underlying ideas and support for zoning changes to increase housing options are present.

### Quotes


> We strongly support City of Yes. But with a few caveats and suggestions that I'll go over now.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote shows general support for the City of Yes proposal, which aligns with the overall positive tone of the reference talking points. However, the mention of 'caveats and suggestions' indicates that the support is not as unequivocal as the reference talking points.

> We think the replacing voluntary inclusion of housing with UAP may result in fewer affordable units in our 10 and special purpose districts.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the UAP (Universal Affordability Preference) mentioned in the reference talking points. However, it expresses concern about its potential negative impact, which contrasts with the wholly positive presentation in the talking points.

> We generally approve, but we think that nothing should proceed without community input.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote, while showing general approval for some aspects of the proposal, emphasizes the importance of community input. This is not directly addressed in the reference talking points, which focus more on the benefits of the proposals.

> For number 3, which is elimination of obstacles to quality housing developments and non contextual zoning districts.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the general theme of the reference talking points about making it easier to build housing, although it doesn't specifically match any of the detailed points provided.

> And then finally, the proposals for low density districts We disapproved for the elimination of the requirement of the building to be situated north coast in 30 feet from the landline.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote expresses disapproval for changes in low-density districts, which doesn't align with the reference talking points that generally support increased density and flexibility in zoning.

> I'd just like to end by saying that for years, our number one district need has been the patient affordable housing. So overall, we're very pleased with City of Yes. I think that it does goes a long way towards creating more affordable housing for our district and for the whole city.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly aligns with the reference talking points' emphasis on the need for affordable housing and the potential of City of Yes to address this need.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a mixed level of alignment with the reference talking points. While there is strong agreement on the overall goal of creating more affordable housing and general support for the City of Yes proposal, the testimony diverges from the reference talking points in several ways:

1. It expresses reservations about the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP), while the talking points are wholly positive about it.
2. It emphasizes the importance of community input and public hearings, which is not a focus of the reference talking points.
3. The testimony doesn't mention several key points from the reference talking points, such as parking minimums, transit-oriented development, ADUs, and shared housing.
4. It expresses disapproval for some changes in low-density districts, which doesn't align with the talking points' support for increased density and flexibility.

However, there are also areas of alignment:
1. General support for the City of Yes proposal.
2. Approval of converting non-residential buildings to residences.
3. Strong emphasis on the need for affordable housing.

Given these factors, the testimony supports some of the same goals as the reference talking points but diverges on specific implementation details and doesn't cover many of the key points. The alignment is moderate, showing support for the overall direction but with significant differences in specific areas.

### Quotes


> We voted in favor of the city of yes for housing opportunity with certain conditions.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote shows general support for the proposal, which aligns with the overall sentiment of the reference talking points, although it's not identical to any specific point.

> We also believe that the ADU maximum square footage should be bumped from 800 square feet to 1200 square feet to allow for the potential for 2 bedroom ADUs.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the ADU talking point in the reference, although it proposes a specific change not mentioned in the reference. It supports the general idea of expanding ADU options.

> We are extremely concerned that UAP as written does not include in the zoning text a requirement that Affordable housing units created with the bonus square footage be made available to the general public.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the UAP talking point from the reference. While it expresses a concern not mentioned in the reference, it shows engagement with the UAP concept and a desire to strengthen its impact on affordable housing.


### Analysis
The testimony shows some alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in its support for the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal and its focus on Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). However, the testimony is more focused on specific concerns and suggestions for improvements rather than promoting the benefits outlined in the reference talking points.

The speaker supports the overall proposal but wants to see certain modifications, such as increased FAR in some zoning districts and larger ADUs. This aligns with the general spirit of the reference talking points about increasing housing density and options, but the specific suggestions are not mentioned in the reference.

The most significant overlap is in the discussion of UAP. While the reference talking points present UAP as a positive development for creating affordable housing, the testimony expresses concern about the lack of explicit guarantees for public access to these affordable units. This shows engagement with the concept but a desire for stronger implementation.

It's notable that the testimony doesn't mention many of the key points from the reference talking points, such as lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, "town center" zoning, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing/SROs. This suggests that while there is some alignment, the testimony is not closely following the provided talking points.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as supporting some of the same goals as the reference talking points, but it is not closely aligned with the specific language or all the points made in the reference.

### Quotes


> This form of an equitable development simply cannot continue if we want the city to work for everyone who lives here.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general idea of equitable development across all neighborhoods, which is a theme present in several of the reference talking points, particularly Transit-Oriented Development and Town Center Zoning.

> The city, yes, for housing opportunity, updates our zoning rules to meet the needs of New Yorkers in an equitable way allowing for more housing of every type.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall goal of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal, which is reflected in all the reference talking points. It specifically mentions updating zoning rules and allowing for more housing of every type.

> This means more income restricted workforce housing, more backyard cottages to support homeowners, and more of the cheapest forms of housing to get New Yorkers out of our shelter system and onto their feet.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly relates to several reference talking points. 'Income restricted workforce housing' aligns with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) point. 'Backyard cottages' refers to Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). 'Cheapest forms of housing' could relate to the Shared Housing (SROs) point.

> The plan will allow for more housing and low density, medium density and high density communities without definitely changing the character of any of these neighborhoods.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the ideas presented in the Transit-Oriented Development and Town Center Zoning points, which aim to add housing in various density areas while maintaining neighborhood character.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, supporting many of the same ideas and arguments. While it doesn't cover all the specific points mentioned in the reference talking points, it strongly advocates for the overall goals of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal. The speaker emphasizes the need for more housing, especially affordable housing, and supports updating zoning rules to allow for diverse housing types across all neighborhoods. This aligns with several key points from the reference talking points, including Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, Town Center Zoning, and Accessory Dwelling Units. The testimony doesn't use the exact language from the talking points, but it conveys similar ideas and supports the same overall objectives.

### Quotes


> I think the sort of straightforward problem is that at the root of our city's housing crisis is a has sing a shortage and to solve it, we need a lot of new housing.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the core issue that the reference talking points are trying to solve. It aligns with the general theme of all the talking points, which is to increase housing supply.

> And CBBS is an elegant solution by adding a little more housing in every neighborhood We can get a lot of new housing without drastic changes to any one community.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall strategy of the City of Yes proposal, which aims to add housing across different neighborhoods. It particularly aligns with the Transit-Oriented Development and Town Center Zoning points, which propose adding small-scale housing in various areas.

> To solve our housing shot housing shortage, we need to make it easier to build housing.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This statement directly supports the overall goal of the City of Yes proposal, which aims to make it easier to build housing through various means such as lifting parking minimums, allowing ADUs, and facilitating office-to-residential conversions.

> More gentrification, more displacement, more segregation, longer commutes from further away, a Manhattan that looks more and more like a gated community.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** While not directly quoting the reference talking points, this statement outlines potential negative consequences that the City of Yes proposal aims to address. It indirectly supports the arguments for Transit-Oriented Development and Town Center Zoning, which aim to create more diverse, accessible communities.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a moderate level of alignment with the reference talking points. While it doesn't go into specific details about the various aspects of the City of Yes proposal, it strongly supports the overall goal of increasing housing supply and making it easier to build housing in New York City.

The speaker's main arguments align with the general themes present in the reference talking points, such as addressing the housing shortage, adding housing across different neighborhoods, and preventing negative consequences like gentrification and displacement.

However, the testimony lacks specific references to individual components of the proposal (such as UAP, parking minimums, TOD, etc.) that are detailed in the reference talking points. The language used is more general and doesn't mirror the specific examples or data points provided in the talking points.

Despite this, the overall message and intent of the testimony clearly support the City of Yes proposal, which is the primary focus of the reference talking points.

> Specifically for the universal affordability preference proposal, I am hearing different things. Right? It sounds like in the materials that were provided by DCP that the 20% additional housing that would be required to be affordable. It's kind of so good as, like, a given. Yes. 20% of the housing will be affordable.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote shows that the speaker is aware of and interested in the Universal Affordability Preference proposal, particularly the 20% affordable housing requirement. This aligns with the reference talking point about UAP, but the speaker is seeking clarification rather than explicitly supporting it.

> And I would encourage the commission and if not, the council members when they vote on this to set a base minimum of deformable units. Right? I think 20% seems fair. So to remove that discretion if it exists

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** Here, the speaker is advocating for a fixed minimum percentage of affordable units, which aligns with the spirit of the UAP talking point about creating more affordable housing. However, the speaker is suggesting this as a modification to the proposal, rather than directly endorsing the proposal as presented.


### Analysis
The testimony shows some awareness and interest in the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) proposal, particularly regarding the percentage of affordable housing required. The speaker seeks clarification on this point and advocates for a fixed minimum percentage, which aligns with the general goal of creating more affordable housing as mentioned in the reference talking points.

However, the majority of the testimony focuses on procedural questions about the hearing itself and requests for clarification, rather than addressing the specific proposals outlined in the reference talking points. The speaker does not mention or discuss other key aspects of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal such as lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, town center zoning, accessory dwelling units, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing.

While there is some alignment on the topic of affordable housing, the testimony does not closely mirror the language or comprehensive set of arguments presented in the reference talking points. The speaker's approach is more inquiring and suggestive rather than strongly advocating for the proposals.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as SUPPORTS_TALKING_POINTS. It shows some support for the affordable housing aspect of the proposal, but does not strongly align with or comprehensively address the full set of reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the idea of creating more housing options, including smaller units, which is similar to the points made in the 'Shared Housing' talking point. Although it doesn't explicitly mention SROs, it highlights the need for diverse housing options.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT

### Analysis
The testimony by Howard Slatkin is related to the reference talking points, but it doesn't make the exact same claims or use very similar language. Instead, it supports many of the same ideas and goals that are presented in the talking points.

The testimony focuses on the broader concept of reversing "zoning for scarcity" and increasing housing capacity in New York City. While it doesn't go into specific details about many of the programs mentioned in the reference talking points (such as lifting parking minimums or transit-oriented development), it does touch on some key themes that align with the overall objectives of the proposed zoning changes.

The testimony supports the idea of creating more housing options, including allowing for the conversion of units and addressing the needs of different household types. This aligns with several of the reference talking points, such as Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and Shared Housing (SROs), although these specific terms are not used in the testimony.

There is a direct mention of the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) program, which is one of the reference talking points. However, the testimony doesn't provide the same level of detail or arguments in favor of the program as the reference talking point does.

Overall, while the testimony doesn't closely mirror the language or specific points of the reference talking points, it does support many of the same goals and ideas, particularly in terms of increasing housing opportunities and addressing the housing crisis in New York City.

> We need affordable housing for very poor low wage working families for disabled people, for our senior citizens, for our parents and our grandparents, for our adult children, so many Staten Islanders are on the verge of homelessness.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the overall goal of the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and Shared Housing (SROs) proposals, which aim to increase affordable housing options for various groups. While it doesn't use the same language, it supports the same objectives.

> Thousands of people live in illegal basement apartments on Staten Island. They there are unscrupulous landlords that rent pieces of basements, $25 a week for a bed.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the need for more affordable housing options, which is addressed in the Shared Housing (SROs) proposal.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote highlights the overcrowding issue, which indirectly supports the need for various proposals in the reference talking points, such as UAP, Transit-Oriented Development, and Shared Housing. It illustrates the urgent need for more affordable housing options.


### Analysis
The testimony by Rev. Terry Troia is related to the reference talking points, but it does not directly mention or advocate for the specific policy proposals outlined in the talking points. Instead, the testimony provides a stark, on-the-ground perspective of the housing crisis in Staten Island, which serves as strong supporting evidence for why such policy changes are necessary.

The testimony focuses on the urgent need for affordable housing, the growth of homelessness, and the substandard living conditions many people face due to the lack of affordable options. This aligns with the overall goals of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, particularly the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and Shared Housing (SROs) aspects.

While Rev. Troia doesn't use the same language or mention specific policies from the reference talking points, her testimony strongly reinforces the need for action to address the housing crisis. The concrete examples and personal observations she provides could be seen as compelling evidence for why the proposed zoning changes and new housing policies are necessary.

In summary, the testimony supports the overall objectives of the reference talking points without directly advocating for the specific proposals. It provides a ground-level perspective that complements and reinforces the need for the policy changes outlined in the talking points.

> There's the potential to align with the center's efforts and many others to ensure New Yorkers have equitable access to newly developed affordable homeownership, specifically coops and condos, to expand access to generational wealth building opportunities especially for New Yorkers who have been shut out of homeownership.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general theme of affordability present in the reference talking points, although it focuses specifically on homeownership rather than rental housing. It aligns with the overall goals of creating more affordable housing opportunities.

> Their 1,400,000, 1 to 4 family homes in the city, and many of these families could benefit from the opportunity to create ADUs. However, we really must emphasize that without a dedicated funding for outreach technical assistance and construction financing, If we allow for ADUs without those pieces, we're just going to increase the racial disparities across communities.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) talking point. It supports the idea of allowing ADUs but emphasizes the need for additional support to ensure equitable implementation. This aligns closely with the reference talking point on ADUs.


### Analysis
The testimony shows some alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in relation to Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and general affordability concerns. However, it doesn't cover many of the specific points mentioned in the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" zoning, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing.

The testimony focuses heavily on affordable homeownership and addressing racial disparities in homeownership, which aligns with the overall theme of affordability present in the reference talking points. However, the specific approaches and solutions mentioned in the testimony differ from those in the reference points.

The strongest alignment is with the ADU talking point, as the testimony directly addresses the potential benefits and challenges of implementing ADUs. The speaker supports the idea but emphasizes the need for additional support and funding to ensure equitable implementation.

While the testimony supports the City of YES Housing proposal with conditions, it doesn't delve into many of the specific zoning changes mentioned in the reference talking points. Instead, it focuses on the potential impact on homeownership opportunities and the need for measures to protect existing homeowners and communities.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points to some extent, but it doesn't show high alignment across all points.

### Quotes


> The proposed text would eliminate most of those zoning issues. And will be eminently useful for increasing the production of much needed housing in the city.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the office-to-residential conversion talking point, highlighting how the proposed changes will facilitate the creation of more housing by eliminating zoning barriers.

> Importantly, the tax broadens the geographical area that can use the special conversion rules, allows buildings up to 1990 to use it, allows existing building floor area and bulk for conversions, allows conversions to supportive housing and dormitories and eliminates or reduces the dwelling unit factor.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely aligns with the office-to-residential conversion talking point, specifically addressing the expansion of eligibility for conversions and the types of housing that can be created.

> The new tax benefit, affordable housing from commercial conversions or AHHC, aligns with the conversion rules it requires 25 percent of rental units to have a weighted average of 80 percent AMI.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the reference talking point about the State passing a new tax exemption to encourage office-to-residential conversions with affordability incentives.

> The revenue committee asks that the new tax clarify the elimination of required parking for conversions, especially in buildings where there had been existing accessory commercial park parking.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** While not directly about lifting parking minimums for new construction, this quote relates to the broader issue of reducing parking requirements, which is a key point in the reference talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly in regard to office-to-residential conversions. The speaker, Carol Rosenthal, focuses heavily on the benefits of the proposed text for facilitating conversions, which aligns very closely with the "Office-to-Residential" talking point provided. 

The testimony covers several key aspects mentioned in the reference talking points, such as expanding the geographical area for conversions, allowing conversions for buildings up to 1990, and the potential for creating affordable housing through these conversions. The mention of a new tax benefit (AHHC) that aligns with the conversion rules is similar to the state tax exemption mentioned in the reference talking points.

While the testimony doesn't cover all the talking points provided (such as Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, or Accessory Dwelling Units), it strongly aligns with the office-to-residential conversion points. Additionally, the testimony touches on parking issues, which relates to the "Lifting Parking Minimums" talking point, although it's not a primary focus of the testimony.

The language used in the testimony is not identical to the reference talking points, but the core arguments and benefits of the proposed changes are very similar. This suggests that while the speaker may not be directly using the provided talking points, they are advocating for the same policy changes and highlighting similar benefits.

### Quotes


> I'm especially excited to see parking minimums lifted, not only because it will help build more housing, but because it is a recognition of a need to move away from car dependency.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly aligns with the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point. The speaker expresses excitement about this specific aspect of the proposal and mentions two key benefits: increasing housing supply and reducing car dependency. These align closely with the points made in the reference talking points about allowing more housing to be built and addressing climate concerns related to car usage.

> I know that even as a homeowner, my ability to afford living in New York is direct impacted by the supply and cost of housing and city.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly reference a specific talking point, it aligns with the overall theme of the proposal, which aims to increase housing supply and affordability. This sentiment is present in various talking points like UAP, TOD, and others that aim to increase housing options.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a moderate level of alignment with the reference talking points. While the speaker strongly supports the "City of Yes" proposal and specifically endorses lifting parking minimums, which aligns closely with one of the major talking points, she doesn't delve into many of the other specific aspects of the proposal mentioned in the reference document.

The speaker's primary focus on parking minimums and general housing affordability suggests that she may be familiar with some aspects of the proposal, but perhaps not the full extent of the talking points provided. Her testimony supports the overall goals of the proposal but doesn't demonstrate the same level of detailed knowledge or argumentation present in the reference talking points.

It's worth noting that the limited scope of her testimony doesn't necessarily indicate disagreement with other aspects of the proposal; rather, she chose to focus on the elements that resonated most with her personal experience and concerns.

> The cost of housing here in New York is out of control, and part because the pace of new construction rides far behind of other comparable cities. This problem can start to be addressed by changing the zoning laws in order to better promote the construction of additional denser housing in more places.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall theme of the reference talking points, which is to increase housing supply through zoning changes. It aligns closely with the general argument presented in multiple talking points, including UAP, TOD, and Town Center Zoning.

> HR is especially pleased to see that the city of yes for housing opportunity plan also includes a number of provisions to ensure that development will be geographically equitable. Previous policies have unfortunately had an unequal impact across different neighborhoods. Favoring development mostly in lower cost areas in the outer boroughs. Whereas very few new affordable units have been built in high opportunity transit rich neighborhoods closer to the city center.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely aligns with the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point, which emphasizes building small apartment buildings near transit in low-density areas. It supports the idea of creating more equitable development across different neighborhoods.

> Implementing the city of yes, will further fair housing in this city by better ensuring that all neighborhoods contribute their fair share to the affordable housing supply.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall goal of the City of Yes plan and aligns with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, which aims to increase affordable housing across the city.


### Analysis
The testimony from Kate Liggett of the Housing Rights Initiative shows a significant level of support for the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity plan. While the testimony doesn't delve into specific details of each element of the plan (such as UAP, parking minimums, or ADUs), it strongly aligns with the overall goals and some key points mentioned in the reference talking points.

The speaker emphasizes the need for zoning changes to promote denser housing construction, which is a central theme across multiple talking points. She specifically supports the City of Yes plan and its provisions for geographically equitable development, which aligns closely with the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point.

The testimony also touches on the importance of fair housing and building affordable units in high-opportunity, transit-rich neighborhoods, which supports the UAP and TOD talking points. While the speaker doesn't use the exact language from the talking points, her arguments and focus areas are very much in line with the plan's objectives.

It's worth noting that the testimony doesn't cover some specific elements mentioned in the talking points, such as parking minimums, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing. However, the overall message and key points strongly support the City of Yes plan and its goals.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general idea of zoning reforms to increase housing capacity, which is a theme across multiple talking points, including TOD and 'Town Center' zoning. However, it doesn't match any specific talking point exactly.

> For too long, many New York City neighborhoods have opted out of adding housing. Perpetuating exclusionary housing policies, making housing development inequitable, and driving up housing costs.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the spirit of the TOD talking point, which aims to allow small apartment buildings in low-density areas near transit. It supports the idea of addressing exclusionary zoning, though it doesn't mention the specific TOD policy.

> With the vacancy rate of only 1.4%, the lowest in 56 years, and half of New York City residents being rent burdened. It is clear that our existing housing policies are unsustainable.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall need for more housing and zoning reforms, which is the underlying principle of all the talking points. However, it doesn't match any specific talking point exactly.

> There were 630 1000 applications for the nitrile waitlist. We know that half of the voucher holders that get a voucher are never successful in using it because of the tight housing market.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the need for more affordable housing options, which aligns with the UAP and SRO talking points. However, it doesn't mention these specific policies.


### Analysis
The testimony is generally supportive of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal and aligns with the overall goals of increasing housing supply and affordability. While it doesn't use the exact language or specific policy details from the reference talking points, it strongly supports the general principles behind the proposal.

The testimony focuses on the urgent need for zoning reforms to address the housing crisis, emphasizing the importance of adding residential capacity in every neighborhood. This aligns with the spirit of several talking points, particularly Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and "Town Center" zoning, which aim to increase housing options in various areas of the city.

The speaker's emphasis on addressing homelessness and the difficulties faced by voucher holders indirectly supports the need for more affordable housing options, which is related to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and Shared Housing (SRO) talking points.

However, the testimony does not delve into specific policy details such as parking minimums, office-to-residential conversions, or Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). Instead, it provides a broader argument for the necessity of the zoning reforms to address the housing crisis.

While the testimony doesn't use identical language to the talking points, it presents arguments that support and align with the overall goals of the "City of Yes" proposal. The speaker's position as the Executive Director of a housing policy organization lends credibility to the testimony and suggests that the alignment with the talking points may be based on shared goals rather than direct influence.

- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall approach of the talking points, which advocate for citywide changes. It aligns with the spirit of all the points that suggest changes across the city, such as lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, and 'Town Center' zoning.


### Analysis
The testimony is generally supportive of the "City of Yes" proposal and aligns with the overall theme of the reference talking points, which is to increase housing production across New York City. The speaker emphasizes the need for more housing of all types in every neighborhood, which is consistent with the broad goals outlined in the talking points.

However, the testimony does not specifically mention or directly address many of the particular policy proposals outlined in the talking points, such as the Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, ADUs, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing. Instead, it focuses on the general need for increased housing production and the negative consequences of the current housing shortage.

The testimony does strongly support the idea of citywide action and warns against exempting certain neighborhoods, which aligns with the spirit of the talking points. It also emphasizes the economic and fiscal benefits of increasing housing production, which, while not directly mentioned in the talking points, supports the overall goal of increasing housing supply.

While the testimony doesn't use the same specific language or examples as the talking points, it does support the same general approach and goals. Therefore, it can be classified as supporting the talking points, even though it doesn't make the exact same claims or use very similar language.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote indirectly supports the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point by emphasizing the need for affordable housing to maintain New York's reputation as a welcoming city for diverse groups. While it doesn't mention UAP directly, it aligns with the goal of creating more affordable housing options.

> City of yes is just a start. This proposal is a great step in the right direction, but it's not nearly enough to fill the gaps cause decades of underbuilding.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote echoes the sentiment found in several of the reference talking points that describe their respective proposals as 'a great step forward.' It supports the overall message that the City of Yes proposal is positive but acknowledges that more action is needed.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with the overall goals and sentiments expressed in the reference talking points, particularly in terms of addressing the housing shortage and affordability crisis in New York City. The speaker enthusiastically supports the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal, which is the foundation of the reference talking points.

While the testimony doesn't explicitly mention or discuss specific elements of the proposal such as parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or accessory dwelling units, it does emphasize the need for more affordable housing and welcoming diverse groups to the city. This aligns closely with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point, even though it's not mentioned by name.

The speaker's call for continued action beyond this proposal, including encouraging more home creation and seeking help from Albany, demonstrates a broader understanding of the housing crisis that is consistent with the comprehensive approach outlined in the reference talking points.

Although the testimony doesn't use the exact language or specific examples from the reference talking points, it strongly supports their main ideas and overall objective of increasing housing availability and affordability in New York City. The speaker's personal anecdotes and emphasis on the city's role as a safe harbor for vulnerable populations add a human element that reinforces the importance of the proposed changes.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points, even though it doesn't directly reference many of the specific proposals outlined in the reference document.

### Analysis
The testimony strongly supports the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity plan and emphasizes the urgent need for affordable housing in NYC. While it doesn't directly mention specific aspects of the plan outlined in the reference talking points (such as Universal Affordability Preference, parking minimums, or Transit-Oriented Development), it aligns with the overall goal of increasing affordable housing availability.

The testimony provides statistical evidence of the housing crisis in NYC and highlights the difficulties faced by those seeking affordable housing. This aligns with the general theme of the reference talking points, which aim to address these issues through various zoning changes and policy adjustments.

The speaker's emphasis on the plan being "rooted in respect for communities and neighborhoods" resonates with the community-focused approach mentioned in several of the reference talking points, particularly those related to Transit-Oriented Development and "Town Center" zoning.

While the testimony doesn't use the exact language or specific points from the reference talking points, it strongly supports the same overall goal of increasing affordable housing in NYC and improving community well-being. The alignment is more in the general intent and desired outcomes rather than in specific policy details.

While it doesn't use the same specific policy language or details, it strongly supports the overall goal of increasing housing supply and affordability in New York City. The speaker emphasizes the need for more housing, which is a central theme in the reference talking points.

The testimony touches on several issues that are addressed in the talking points, such as the housing crisis, affordability for working-class residents, and the importance of creating housing opportunities in various neighborhoods. However, it doesn't go into the same level of detail or mention specific policies like UAP, TOD, or parking minimum removals.

The speaker's emphasis on "any new housing is good housing" aligns well with the pro-development stance of the talking points, even if it doesn't mention specific types of housing (like ADUs or office-to-residential conversions) that are highlighted in the reference document.

While the alignment isn't extremely high due to the lack of specific policy mentions, the overall message and intent of the testimony strongly supports the goals outlined in the reference talking points.

> We support the universal preference and the allowance to increase density with provision that you must build 60 per you must present build 20 percent more housing that is permanently affordable at an average of 60%. AMI.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly aligns with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point. It mentions increased density and permanent affordability, which are key aspects of the UAP.

> We're generally supportive of provisions and make it easier for congregations to build affordable housing and we also support the landmark provision that lets congregations transfer development rights to properties which are close by in exchange for funds to fix up aging properties.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While not explicitly mentioned in the reference talking points, this quote supports the general idea of making it easier to build affordable housing, which is a theme throughout the talking points. The transfer of development rights is a unique point not covered in the reference talking points.

> Finally, I make a plea to the city to not oversell city of yes, and be as clear as you can about what the text amendment can and can't do.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote shows a more cautious approach to the City of Yes proposal, which is not directly addressed in the reference talking points. However, it still indicates support for the proposal while acknowledging its limitations.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a significant alignment with some of the reference talking points, particularly regarding the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP). The speaker explicitly supports increased density with affordable housing requirements, which is a key aspect of the UAP talking point. 

However, the testimony does not cover many of the other talking points such as parking minimums, transit-oriented development, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing. The speaker focuses more on aspects related to religious organizations and their role in affordable housing development.

While the overall tone is supportive of the City of Yes proposal, which aligns with the general stance of the reference talking points, the testimony is more limited in scope and adds some cautions about overselling the proposal's impact.

Given these observations, the testimony supports the talking points to some extent but does not show high alignment across all areas covered in the reference talking points.

> New York City must take all possible measures to increase the supply of affordable housing which fish strongly supports the zoning changes outlined in City of Yes for Housing.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall goal of the City of Yes for Housing proposal, which is mentioned in multiple reference talking points. It shows a general alignment with the proposal's objectives.

> We support universal affordability preference because it won't mean additional affordable and port of housing would be built by giving developments of density bonus.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly relates to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point. It supports the idea of providing extra floor area for permanent affordable housing, which is a key aspect of the UAP.

> We support the aspects of City of Yes that would allow for the development of small shared housing, which could significantly increase housing apply, but our experience running that kind of housing has shown that it must be paired with adequately funded on-site services.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the Shared Housing (SRO) talking point. It supports the idea of allowing shared housing, which aligns with the reference talking point. However, it adds the condition of needing on-site services, which is not mentioned in the reference points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows significant alignment with some of the reference talking points, particularly those related to Universal Affordability Preference and Shared Housing. The speaker strongly supports the City of Yes for Housing proposal, which is the overarching theme of the reference talking points.

However, the testimony has a much narrower focus on senior affordable housing, which is not specifically addressed in the reference talking points. The speaker doesn't mention or support several key aspects of the talking points, such as lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or office-to-residential conversions.

While the testimony supports the general goal of increasing affordable housing supply, it also emphasizes the need for additional incentives specifically for senior housing, which goes beyond the scope of the reference talking points.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as SUPPORTS_TALKING_POINTS. It aligns with and supports some key aspects of the reference talking points, but it doesn't cover the full range of points and has a more specific focus on senior housing.

It aligns with the idea that change is necessary for addressing housing issues.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a clear support for the City of Yes proposal and its goals of increasing housing supply and affordability. While the speaker doesn't use specific terminology or mention particular aspects of the proposal, his overall message aligns well with the reference talking points.

The testimony emphasizes the need for more housing "everywhere" to address affordability concerns, which is a central theme in many of the talking points. The speaker's appreciation for the dynamic nature of New York City and his willingness to embrace change also aligns with the spirit of the proposal, which aims to update zoning laws to allow for more housing options.

Although the testimony doesn't go into specifics about individual components like UAP, TOD, or lifting parking minimums, the general support for more housing and openness to change could be seen as indirectly supporting these ideas.

The level of alignment is not as high as it could be if the speaker had used specific terminology or referenced particular aspects of the proposal. However, the overall sentiment and goals expressed in the testimony are very much in line with the reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the creation of more affordable housing, which is a key theme in the reference talking points, particularly in the UAP section.


### Analysis
The testimony shows support for the City of Yes proposal and emphasizes the need for more housing, particularly affordable housing, in New York City. While these themes align with the overall goals expressed in the reference talking points, the testimony lacks specific details or arguments that directly mirror the talking points.

The testifier expresses general support for increased housing development and affordability, which are central themes in the reference talking points. However, he doesn't mention any specific policies or proposals outlined in the talking points, such as the Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, or transit-oriented development.

The testimony seems to come from personal experience and observation rather than from a detailed understanding of the specific policies proposed in the City of Yes plan. While it supports the overall direction of the plan, it doesn't demonstrate a high level of alignment with the specific arguments and points provided in the reference document.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points in a general sense, but not showing high alignment with the specific details and arguments provided.

### Quotes

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall rationale behind the 'City of Yes for Housing Opportunity' proposal, emphasizing the need for more housing supply. While it doesn't directly reference a specific talking point, it aligns with the general argument for zoning reforms and increased housing production.

> The best way to get that is to legalize housing by reforming our outdated zoning code.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This statement supports the overall goal of the 'City of Yes' proposal, which aims to reform zoning codes. It aligns with the rationale behind various talking points like Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, and 'Town Center' Zoning, although it doesn't mention them specifically.

> We need more housing at all income levels from subsidized affordable to market rate.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the idea of diverse housing options, which is present in various talking points such as Universal Affordability Preference and Shared Housing. It aligns with the overall goal of increasing housing supply across different affordability levels.

> While many of the comments today, including my own, have focused on ending the housing crisis, it's important to note that housing is also a transfer patient issue. The school is an education issue. It's a health and safety issue. It's an economic issue.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This statement recognizes the multifaceted nature of the housing crisis, which is implied in various talking points. It supports the idea that housing reforms have wide-ranging benefits, aligning with arguments made for Transit-Oriented Development and 'Town Center' Zoning.


### Analysis
The testimony is generally supportive of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal and aligns with many of the ideas presented in the reference talking points. While the speaker doesn't go into specific details about the proposal's components, their overall message strongly advocates for zoning reforms to increase housing supply and address the housing crisis in New York City.

The testimony emphasizes the severity of the housing shortage, the need for zoning reform, and the importance of increasing housing supply at all income levels. These points are consistent with the overarching themes in the reference talking points, particularly those related to Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, and 'Town Center' Zoning.

The speaker also touches on the multifaceted nature of the housing crisis, mentioning its impacts on transportation, education, health, and the economy. This aligns with the broader arguments made in the reference talking points about the benefits of various zoning reforms.

However, the testimony doesn't directly mention or elaborate on specific components of the proposal such as lifting parking minimums, accessory dwelling units, or office-to-residential conversions. The alignment is more in the general support for zoning reform and increased housing supply rather than in the specific details of the proposal.

Given the strong support for the proposal and the alignment with the overall goals and rationale behind the reference talking points, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points, even though it doesn't make the exact same arguments or use very similar language.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall theme of the reference talking points, particularly aligning with the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and other zoning changes mentioned.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the general theme of affordability in the reference talking points, particularly aligning with the UAP section.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the overall sentiment of the reference talking points, particularly the emphasis on affordability for all income levels. It supports the general goal of the 'City of Yes' proposal without going into specific details.


### Analysis
The testimony is supporting the same claims and arguments as the talking points, but it does not make the exact same ones or use very similar language. The speaker, Eric Rosenbaum, strongly supports the "City of Yes" proposal and emphasizes the importance of affordable housing, which aligns with the core message of the reference talking points. However, his testimony focuses more on the broader impact of affordable housing on issues like homelessness, mental health, and public safety, rather than detailing specific zoning changes mentioned in the talking points. While there is clear support for the overall goals of the proposal, the testimony doesn't delve into the specific points like UAP, parking minimums, TOD, or other detailed aspects mentioned in the reference talking points. The alignment is more in the general sentiment and overarching goals rather than in specific policy details.

> 2nd, the legalization of accessory dwelling units can increase density in historic neighborhoods without demolition while providing much needed housing.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the reference talking point on Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). Both the testimony and the talking points emphasize the benefit of adding housing without significant changes to existing structures.

> 3rd, the elimination of parking minimums. It's a positive step for the city. We talk about that too in the housing policy statement.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns closely with the reference talking point on Lifting Parking Minimums. Both the testimony and the talking points view this as a positive change, though the testimony doesn't go into the detailed reasoning provided in the talking points.

> First, ACHP policy supports stoning changes to legalize the conversion of nonresidential structures for residential uses As you've seen in the financial district, this can have tremendous impact in ensuring our historic resources continue to serve our community.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the Office-to-Residential conversion talking point. While the testimony focuses on the historic preservation aspect, it supports the same concept of converting non-residential structures to residential use.


### Analysis
The testimony by Sara Bronin, representing the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, shows a moderate level of alignment with the provided reference talking points. While there are some clear areas of overlap, particularly regarding Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and the elimination of parking minimums, the testimony has a distinct focus on historic preservation that is not prominent in the reference talking points.

The testimony supports several key aspects of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, including office-to-residential conversions, ADUs, and the elimination of parking minimums. These align with some of the reference talking points, showing a shared interest in increasing housing supply and making better use of existing structures.

However, the testimony does not mention several important aspects of the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" Zoning, or Shared Housing. This suggests that while there is some alignment, the testimony is not comprehensively covering all the points that the reference talking points emphasize.

The testimony also brings up additional points related to historic preservation, such as the transfer of development rights from landmark buildings and the treatment of historic campuses, which are not mentioned in the reference talking points.

Given these observations, we can conclude that while there is some significant overlap, particularly in the areas of ADUs and parking minimums, the testimony is not fully aligned with all aspects of the reference talking points and has its own distinct focus on historic preservation.

> We have found that 40 units is generally the number where projects can fill out. All too often, we find that current zoning prevents houses of worship from building the number of units which would make it a project feasible. The city of yes, would enable these congregations to move forward with building for their communities.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the idea of allowing more housing units, which is related to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking points. However, it's specifically focused on faith-based organizations rather than general development.

> The city of Yes, has the potential to increase housing in the community that needs it most. And I say potential because creating the conditions right for affordable housing development are necessary and zoning is only one part of that equation.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote acknowledges the potential of the City of Yes proposal to increase housing, which aligns with the general theme of the reference talking points. However, it also expresses a more cautious view by noting that zoning is only one part of the solution.

> I would like to believe that if we build more housing, costs would be lower. I would like to believe that if we open up all areas of the city for development, the developers would choose to develop in those areas that are more wealthy and have traditionally refused building housing instead of gravitating toward historically lower income areas that have less resources to fend off development.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote expresses skepticism about some of the assumptions underlying the reference talking points, particularly the idea that increasing housing supply will necessarily lower costs or lead to more equitable development across the city.


### Analysis
The testimony shows some alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in recognizing the need for affordable housing and acknowledging that zoning changes could potentially increase housing supply. However, the speaker presents a more nuanced and cautious perspective on the City of Yes proposal.

While the testimony supports the general idea of creating more affordable housing, it doesn't directly address many of the specific points mentioned in the reference talking points, such as parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, or office-to-residential conversions. The speaker focuses more on the challenges faced by faith-based organizations in developing affordable housing and expresses some skepticism about whether the proposed changes will achieve their intended goals.

The testimony does not show high alignment with the reference talking points, as it doesn't use similar language or make the same specific arguments. However, it does support some of the underlying principles, such as the need for zoning changes to facilitate affordable housing development. The speaker's more cautious approach and acknowledgment of potential drawbacks or limitations of the proposal set it apart from the more enthusiastic tone of the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> The first is repeal and parking mandates. So so not only is this environmental for environmentally friendly, it's also economically progressive. Parking spots don't get billed for free. So when we force developers to build parking, they pass on the costs in the form of higher rents.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly aligns with the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point. It mentions environmental benefits and increased costs passed on to renters, which are key arguments in the reference talking points.

> People who own cars would be paying for the parking anyway, but people who don't own cars cars have to pay extra rent for something they don't need. And since people who don't own cars tend to be less wealthy than people who do, the ultimate economic effect is that the less wealthy are subsidizing the more wealthy.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point by elaborating on the regressive nature of parking mandates. While not identical to the reference points, it strongly supports the argument that parking mandates are unnecessary and economically unfair.

> The second part that I really like is legalizing SROs, and The reason I wanted to highlight this is because I myself have lived in in an SRO in the past when I couldn't afford a full apartment to myself because the SRO was more affordable.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly relates to the 'Shared Housing (aka "Single-Room Occupancy" [SROs])' talking point. It provides personal testimony supporting the argument that SROs are a necessary low-cost housing option, which aligns closely with the reference talking points.

> Legalizing SROs is a great way to add more housing that's affordable to people who let people who like myself in the past. Aren't wealthy enough to afford a full apartment to to themselves.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote further supports the SRO talking point by emphasizing how legalizing SROs would add more affordable housing options. This aligns with the reference point about addressing housing and homelessness crises.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a high level of alignment with two specific aspects of the reference talking points: lifting parking minimums and legalizing SROs. The speaker's arguments closely mirror those provided in the reference document, often making the same claims and using similar reasoning.

For the parking minimums, the testimony covers environmental benefits, economic progressiveness, and the regressive nature of forcing non-car owners to subsidize car owners through higher rents. These points are nearly identical to those in the reference talking points.

Regarding SROs, the speaker provides personal experience to support the talking points about SROs being a necessary low-cost housing option and their potential to address the housing crisis.

However, the testimony does not cover other aspects of the City of Yes proposal mentioned in the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" Zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, or Office-to-Residential conversions.

While the alignment is very high for the topics covered, the limited scope of the testimony (focusing on only two aspects of the proposal) prevents it from being classified as having the highest level of alignment with the full set of reference talking points.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns closely with the general sentiment expressed in the UAP talking points about the need for affordable housing. While it doesn't use identical language, it strongly supports the same argument.

> We are strongly in favor of the UAP that will provide more floor area ratio bonuses build more buildings and more supportive housing.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the UAP talking point, mentioning the floor area bonus for affordable housing. The language is very similar to the reference talking point.

> I want to be clear that restrictive zoning that is resulting in a system of de facto dough redlining as a vestige of slavery in Jim Crow. Black and brown in lower income New Yorkers where we see the most migration have been disproportionately impacted by these trends and addressing these historic and present day harms as mission critical.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly match any specific talking point, it supports the overall goal of the City of Yes proposal to address inequities in housing. It provides additional context on why zoning reform is necessary, which aligns with the spirit of the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a significant alignment with the reference talking points, particularly regarding the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and the overall goals of the City of Yes proposal. The speaker strongly supports the UAP and recognizes the critical need for affordable and supportive housing, which directly aligns with the provided talking points.

However, the testimony also brings up specific concerns and requests that are not addressed in the reference talking points. These include issues related to the off-site option for generating certificates or bonuses, the permanence of existing air rights, and the need for specific zoning text considerations for supportive housing.

While these concerns indicate that the testimony is not entirely identical to the reference talking points, they do not contradict the overall goals. Instead, they represent a more nuanced perspective from an organization specifically focused on supportive housing.

The testimony does not cover all aspects of the City of Yes proposal mentioned in the reference talking points, such as lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, or office-to-residential conversions. It focuses primarily on the aspects most relevant to supportive housing.

Given these factors, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points, but with a more specific focus and additional concerns not covered in the reference material.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the talking point on lifting parking minimums. Although brief, it clearly indicates the speaker's support for this aspect of the proposal.

> Legalizing ADUs

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the talking point on Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). The speaker explicitly mentions legalizing ADUs as part of the proposals he supports.

> office presidential conversions

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote, likely meant to be 'office-to-residential conversions', directly supports the talking point on Office-to-Residential conversions. The speaker mentions this as one of the proposals he supports.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a moderate level of alignment with the reference talking points. While it doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference document, it does explicitly support several key aspects of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal. 

The speaker, Adam Brodheim, focuses primarily on the transfer of development rights for landmark buildings, which is not directly mentioned in the reference talking points. However, he does explicitly support lifting parking minimums, legalizing ADUs, and office-to-residential conversions, all of which are key points in the reference document.

The testimony doesn't mention some major talking points like the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP), Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), "Town Center" zoning, or Shared Housing (SROs). However, the overall sentiment of the testimony aligns with the goals of the proposal, emphasizing the need for new housing and density while preserving the character of historic districts.

While the alignment is not extremely high due to the omission of several key talking points, the testimony does support multiple important aspects of the proposal and shares the overall vision for increased housing opportunities in New York City.

### Quotes


> I'd like to express my enthusiasm stick support for city of yes in its entirety

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly expresses support for the entire City of Yes program, which includes all the reference talking points. While it doesn't go into specifics, it shows a high level of alignment with the overall goals of the program.

> The exclusionary restrictive zoning of much of New York City forces veterans to live in substandard conditions and have lengthy lengthy commutes.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the goals of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and the overall aim of the City of Yes program to reduce exclusionary zoning. It supports the idea of creating more housing opportunities near transit to reduce commute times.

> That means that that family and that veteran can only afford a monthly rent. Or mortgage expense of $2950 a month in order to not be considered rent burden. And that's too low to afford to live in many areas of our city and also means that home ownership is unrealistic and unthinkable at current housing prices.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly reference a specific talking point, it strongly supports the overall goal of the City of Yes program to create more affordable housing options. It aligns with the intent behind measures like UAP, TOD, and Shared Housing.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong support for the City of Yes program, particularly in its goals to address housing affordability and accessibility. While the speaker doesn't explicitly mention many of the specific proposals outlined in the reference talking points, his overall message aligns well with the program's objectives.

The testimony focuses primarily on the challenges faced by veterans in finding affordable housing in New York City, which is a specific angle not directly addressed in the reference talking points. However, this perspective reinforces the need for the various measures proposed in the City of Yes program.

The speaker's emphasis on the negative impacts of exclusionary zoning and the need for more affordable housing options in different areas of the city aligns well with several of the program's proposals, such as Transit-Oriented Development, Universal Affordability Preference, and the concept of Shared Housing.

While the testimony doesn't go into the technical details of the proposals, it provides a strong emotional and practical argument for why such changes are necessary, using the experiences of veterans as a compelling example.

Overall, the testimony supports the City of Yes program and its goals, even if it doesn't explicitly reference each individual proposal.

### Quotes


> I am absolutely in favor of the proposal to legalize the development of ADUs.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the reference talking point on Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). However, Gibson adds a caveat about the need for increased inspections and community engagement, which is not mentioned in the reference talking points.

> By focusing on areas within a half mile of transit, We can ensure that everyone can truly get around the Bronx and the Sea without adding more cars to our already congested streets.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point, supporting the idea of building near transit to create sustainable communities and reduce car dependency.

> I do not support the proposal to increase small and shared housing and to decrease the Duf. The dwelling unit factor, and let me explain why. The Bronx is already seeing an influx of smaller and smaller and smaller units and many of these new development projects.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote directly opposes the reference talking point on Shared Housing (SROs). While the talking points advocate for bringing back smaller units with shared facilities, Gibson argues against this, preferring larger units for families.

> I also do not support the removal of parking mandates. No surprise there. I'll tell you why. This proposal may work in many high density areas with significant access to transit, but simply put, it does not work in many neighborhoods in the Bronx.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote directly contradicts the reference talking point on Lifting Parking Minimums. While the talking points argue for removing parking requirements to reduce housing costs and encourage transit use, Gibson opposes this, especially for areas with limited transit access.


### Analysis
The testimony by Vanessa Gibson shows a mixed alignment with the reference talking points. While she supports some aspects of the proposal, such as ADUs and transit-oriented development, she strongly disagrees with others, particularly the removal of parking mandates and the increase in small and shared housing. Her focus is primarily on the specific needs of the Bronx, emphasizing the importance of family-sized units and considering areas with limited transit access. This nuanced approach demonstrates that while she agrees with some of the overall goals of increasing housing opportunities, her perspective is more tailored to her constituency's needs rather than fully aligning with the provided talking points.

### Quotes


> We are stuck in a sixty plus year old zoning regime And that status quo is what is leading to the crisis.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the overall message of the reference talking points, which aim to update and improve zoning laws. It supports the need for changes like the Universal Affordability Preference, Transit-Oriented Development, and other proposed zoning updates.

> We know that we need to build affordable housing, income restricted housing, but we are not just facing a crisis of affordable housing, but a crisis of housing affordability. And to address that crisis, we must add housing of all types all across the city.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely aligns with the overall message of the reference talking points, particularly the emphasis on creating both affordable housing and addressing general housing affordability. It supports points made about Universal Affordability Preference and the need for various housing types.

> So I urge approval of CDS for housing opportunity in its strongest possible form to address the affordability crisis, but also to promote the dense walkable neighborhoods that are our superpower in fighting climate change, which is also an existential threat to the city over the long term.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports multiple talking points, including the emphasis on affordability and the benefits of dense, walkable neighborhoods. It particularly aligns with the Transit-Oriented Development and Town Center Zoning points, which promote these types of communities.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a strong alignment with the overall goals and rationale behind the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal, as outlined in the reference talking points. While the speaker doesn't explicitly mention specific elements of the proposal (such as UAP, parking minimums, or TOD), their arguments strongly support the need for zoning changes to address the housing crisis and promote affordability.

The testimony emphasizes the importance of creating more housing of all types across the city, which aligns with the various initiatives proposed in the talking points. The speaker's focus on dense, walkable neighborhoods and their benefits for sustainability directly supports the Transit-Oriented Development and Town Center Zoning concepts.

Although the testimony doesn't use the exact language or specific policy details from the talking points, it presents a compelling case for the same underlying principles and goals. The speaker's personal story and emphasis on preserving New York's vitality and opportunity further reinforce the importance of the proposed changes.

### Quotes


> City of yes for housing opportunity addresses these glaring inequities by returning to the transit focused housing policies that enabled our rail networks expansion in the early 20th century.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the concept of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) mentioned in the reference talking points. While the language is not identical, the idea of connecting housing policies with transit is the same.

> During that time, policies included in the city, yes, for housing opportunities such as accessory dwelling units, transit oriented development, and the absence of parking mandates were known by a different name. Common sense.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote explicitly mentions three key points from the reference talking points: accessory dwelling units (ADUs), transit oriented development (TOD), and the absence of parking mandates. The language is very similar to the reference points, though it frames these as historical policies rather than new proposals.

> Getting back to basics will help the city and the MTA as both continue to recover. From the from pandemic ridership losses by bringing riders closer to stations, thereby encouraging and improving ridership and simultaneously fair revenue.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the idea of Transit-Oriented Development, emphasizing the benefits of having people live close to transit stations. While not using identical language, it aligns closely with the TOD talking point about creating sustainable and walkable communities and encouraging transit ridership.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a significant alignment with several key points from the reference talking points, particularly in relation to transit-oriented development and lifting parking mandates. The speaker explicitly mentions and supports concepts such as accessory dwelling units, transit-oriented development, and the absence of parking mandates, which are central to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal.

However, the testimony focuses more heavily on transit-related issues and the benefits to MTA riders, which is not a primary focus of the reference talking points. The testimony does not cover all aspects of the reference talking points, notably missing discussion on Universal Affordability Preference, Office-to-Residential conversions, "Town Center" Zoning, or Shared Housing/SROs.

While the exact language used in the testimony is not identical to the reference talking points, the underlying concepts and support for the proposal are very similar, especially in the areas that are covered. The testimony provides a strong endorsement of the proposal from a transit-oriented perspective, which aligns well with several of the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> We support many components of the housing opportunity proposal and believe it will help address the city's housing crisis.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote shows general support for the housing proposal, which aligns with the overall sentiment of the reference talking points. However, it doesn't directly reference any specific talking point.

> However, we are concerned that the proposed UAP formula as it applies to zoning lots with existing buildings to remain may have the unintended effect of disincentivizing housing development.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the UAP, which is a key point in the reference talking points. However, it presents a concern not mentioned in the reference talking points, which only highlight positive aspects of UAP.

> We urge the commission to consider alternatives to the UAP formula as it applies to these infill sites.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote suggests modifications to the UAP formula, which is not mentioned in the reference talking points. The talking points present UAP as a straightforward positive, while this testimony suggests it needs refinement.


### Analysis
The testimony is partially aligned with the reference talking points, but it also diverges significantly in some areas. While the speaker supports the overall goal of addressing the housing crisis, which is in line with the general sentiment of the talking points, he raises specific concerns about the UAP formula that are not addressed in the reference talking points.

The testimony focuses almost exclusively on the UAP, which is only one aspect of the reference talking points. The speaker's detailed analysis and suggestions for improving the UAP formula show a level of engagement with the topic that goes beyond what's presented in the reference talking points.

Importantly, the testimony doesn't mention any of the other key points from the reference talking points, such as lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, town center zoning, ADUs, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing.

The testimony appears to come from a perspective of property owners and developers, focusing on the practicalities and potential unintended consequences of the UAP formula. This differs from the more general, positive presentation of UAP in the reference talking points.

While there is some alignment in the overall goal of increasing housing supply, including affordable housing, the specific approach and concerns raised in the testimony are not closely aligned with the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> I'm here to endorse every component of the city of yes.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote shows general support for the entire 'City of Yes' proposal, which aligns with the overall message of the reference talking points. However, it doesn't mention any specific components.

> It's allowing just 3 to 5 story buildings near mass transit, and I'm concerned that it may not be enough.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly relates to the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) talking point. However, while the speaker supports TOD, he argues for taller buildings than what the proposal suggests, which slightly diverges from the reference talking point.

> City of Yes is essential, but it is a sensitive community development bill, not a radical envy bill. It will meet 20% of mayor Adams housing goal as we've heard today.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the overall aim of the 'City of Yes' proposal to increase housing supply, which aligns with the general theme of the reference talking points. However, it doesn't match exactly with any specific talking point.


### Analysis
The testimony shows support for the "City of Yes" proposal and specifically addresses the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) component. While the speaker endorses the overall proposal, he argues for taller buildings near transit than what is currently proposed. This shows a general alignment with the reference talking points, especially regarding the need for increased housing supply and TOD.

However, the testimony doesn't directly address many of the specific components mentioned in the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, "Town Center" zoning, ADUs, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing. The speaker's focus is primarily on the TOD aspect and the overall goal of increasing housing supply.

The testimony supports the general direction of the "City of Yes" proposal but suggests that it could go further in terms of building height near transit. This indicates that while there is alignment with the core ideas, the speaker believes the proposal could be more ambitious in some aspects.

Given these observations, the testimony can be classified as supporting the talking points, but not showing high alignment due to the limited coverage of specific components and the push for more ambitious TOD guidelines.

> Bronxboro supports the city of Yes Don't even reform legislation.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall message of the reference talking points, which advocate for the City of Yes zoning reform. While it doesn't mention any specific aspect of the reform, it shows general alignment with the goals of the legislation.

> There's a dire need for more affordable housing options in our city. For our Melrose North project, we are about to finish leasing, we received over 67,000 applicants or just 67 lottery units. That's one thousand people for every one available unit.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly supports the need for more affordable housing, which is a central theme in the reference talking points, particularly in the UAP section. While it doesn't use the exact language from the talking points, it provides compelling evidence for the same argument.

> And even one of those years I lived in what you would call a modern day SRO, where at one point I had 10 roommates. It worked out. It was a good choice.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the 'Shared Housing' talking point, which discusses bringing back SROs. While the speaker doesn't explicitly advocate for legalizing SROs, his positive personal experience with this type of housing supports the argument made in the talking points.

> City of yes, a step in the right direction to alleviate the housing crunch and ensure young families or people just move into the city can make it here.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the overall message of the reference talking points, emphasizing the need for more housing options and supporting the City of Yes initiative. It doesn't mention specific aspects of the reform but supports the general goal.


### Analysis
The testimony is generally supportive of the City of Yes zoning reform legislation and emphasizes the need for more affordable housing options in New York City. While it doesn't cover all the specific points mentioned in the reference talking points, it strongly aligns with the overall message and goals of the proposed reforms.

The speaker, representing an affordable housing developer, provides compelling evidence for the need for more affordable housing, which is a central theme in the reference talking points. He also shares personal experiences that relate to some of the issues addressed in the talking points, particularly regarding shared housing or SROs.

However, the testimony doesn't explicitly mention or discuss many of the specific zoning changes proposed in the talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" zoning, office-to-residential conversions, or Accessory Dwelling Units.

Despite not covering all the specific points, the testimony's strong support for zoning reform to increase affordable housing options and its alignment with the overall goals of the City of Yes initiative suggest that it SUPPORTS_TALKING_POINTS.

> I'd like to speak specifically in favor of the universal affordability preference. I think every time we look at new housing as well, why is it more affordable? Why aren't they building more affordable housing? We all support more affordable housing. How do we actually make that happen? How do we make the buildings? Actually get built.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the UAP talking point. While it doesn't use the exact language from the reference points, it emphasizes the need for more affordable housing and questions how to make it happen, which aligns with the goals of UAP.

> UAP makes the buildings more profitable because say it's not saying, you know, take some of your existing housing, make make make these units affordable. So you can build even more units that are affordable. It's it's a it's a win win.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote closely aligns with the UAP talking point about making developments more efficient and easier to finance. It also emphasizes the increase in affordable housing, which is a key point in the reference talking points.

> I'd also like to speak quickly in favor for moving parking minimums. I know speak people have spoken in favor of that. I'd just like to say personally, because people say, you know, while this won't get people out of their cars, it'll just put more pressure on parking.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the talking point about lifting parking minimums. It addresses a common concern and aligns with the reference points about reducing car dependency.

> In New York City, especially when especially when you're building new buildings, if you say here's a building with no parking, people who move in will commute with some way other than a private vehicle. That all, as people said, lower cost construction, get us more affordability, hopefully use a space.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly supports the talking points about lifting parking minimums. It mentions lower construction costs and increased affordability, which are key points in the reference talking points. It also touches on the idea of reducing car usage, which aligns with the climate-related points in the reference.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly on the topics of Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and removing parking minimums. The speaker's arguments and rationale align well with those provided in the reference talking points, although the exact language differs. The testimony supports the same claims and arguments as the talking points for these two aspects of the proposal, showing a high level of alignment in content if not in specific wording. However, the testimony does not cover other aspects of the proposal mentioned in the reference talking points, which prevents it from being classified as having the highest level of alignment.

> We support the intention of the text amendment to introduce more opportunity for housing development and importantly affordability in New York City Neighborhoods and across New York City Neighborhoods, particularly and importantly, in those that have not done their fair share in the recent decades.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the overall intention of the UAP program as described in the reference talking points. It emphasizes the importance of creating more affordable housing opportunities across the city, which is a key point in the UAP description.

> On UAP specifically, one of the things that we're recommending is that the income averaging, as Cherilyn, pointed out, it's not a 60% it's a percent averaging be adjusted to include a mandated deaffordability proportion, right?

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote discusses a specific aspect of the UAP program - income averaging. While the reference talking points don't go into this level of detail, the speaker's recommendation aligns with the overall goal of creating more deeply affordable housing, which is mentioned in the talking points.

> You have a max f a r in errors, and then you have a max affordable in ears, and actually those are not consistent by various different districts. Heard a lot. You all have heard a lot from people who feel very strongly against density, but a lot of these UAP areas are actually places that have consistently said we will take density for affordability.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote relates to the density bonus aspect of UAP, which is mentioned in the reference talking points. The speaker is pointing out that many communities are willing to accept increased density in exchange for affordability, which supports the talking point about 'A little bit denser buildings - and not necessarily even taller buildings - is well worth it to get this new housing.'


### Analysis
The testimony by Barika Williams shows a significant alignment with the reference talking points, particularly regarding the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) aspect of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal. While the testimony doesn't cover all aspects of the proposal mentioned in the talking points, it strongly supports the core intentions of creating more affordable housing opportunities across New York City.

The speaker expresses explicit support for the text amendment's goals, which aligns closely with the reference talking points. She goes into more technical detail about aspects of the UAP program, such as income averaging and density bonuses, demonstrating a deep understanding of the policy and its potential impacts.

The testimony emphasizes the importance of deep affordability and ensuring that all neighborhoods contribute to affordable housing development, which resonates with the reference talking points' priority on getting "deeply affordable housing in new developments."

While the speaker suggests some modifications to the proposal, these are generally in line with the overall goals outlined in the talking points, aiming to strengthen the affordability components of the program.

The testimony doesn't contradict any of the other aspects of the proposal mentioned in the reference talking points (such as parking minimums, TOD, etc.), but it also doesn't explicitly address them, focusing primarily on UAP.

Overall, the testimony can be characterized as supportive of the proposal's main intentions, with suggestions for modifications that would potentially strengthen its affordability outcomes.

> For too long, New York City has required Wall Street parking spaces to be incorporated into housing developments regardless their proximity to public transit. Removing this mandate is long overdue. It would allow space that was once reserved for motor vehicles to now be used to produce apartments for New Yorkers.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the 'Lifting Parking Minimums' talking point. While the language is not identical, the argument is the same: removing parking mandates will allow for more housing to be built.

> The UAP would also greatly benefit both Catholic Charities Housing Programs by providing a 20% additional affordable housing units in medium and high density districts where the underlying development is 100% affordable.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the 'Universal Affordability Preference (UAP)' talking point. While it doesn't go into as much detail as the reference talking point, it does highlight the benefit of additional affordable housing units.

> We are also strongly supportive of the zoning text amendment that encourages the residential conversion of office and commercial buildings.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the 'Office-to-Residential' talking point. While it doesn't provide as much detail, it expresses strong support for the same concept.


### Analysis
The testimony by Joseph Rosenberg shows a strong alignment with several key points from the reference talking points. While the language used is not identical, the concepts and support for the initiatives are very similar. The testimony focuses on removing parking mandates, supporting the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP), and encouraging office-to-residential conversions, which are all major points in the reference talking points.

The speaker also mentions additional aspects of the City of Yes proposal that are not explicitly covered in the reference talking points, such as landmark building development rights transfer and infill initiatives for campuses. This suggests that the speaker has a comprehensive understanding of the proposal and is not simply reciting prepared talking points.

However, the testimony does not cover all aspects mentioned in the reference talking points, such as Transit-Oriented Development, Town Center Zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, and Shared Housing. This could be due to time constraints or because these aspects are less relevant to the Catholic organizations the speaker represents.

Overall, while the testimony doesn't cover every point in the reference talking points, it strongly aligns with several key points and demonstrates a clear support for the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal.

### Quotes


> And all of the elements of this proposal are clear in 3 months till the zoning code and will allow and will allow a bit more housing to be built, including much needed affordable housing via the universal affordability preference.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly mentions the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) and its role in creating affordable housing, which is a key point in the reference talking points.

> Lifting parking mandates will also help. Right? Because the way that it currently works with the minimums that we have that subsidizes cars and increases traffic, which we don't know we have way too much of already in a city where less than half of households even have a car.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote strongly aligns with the reference talking points on lifting parking minimums, mentioning how current minimums subsidize cars and increase traffic, which are key arguments in the talking points.

> And moving on to transit oriented development. The element in this proposal seems very limited to me, both in terms of it doesn't apply to many lots in the areas that are near transit, and the size of the buildings is pretty small.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote discusses transit-oriented development, which is a key point in the reference talking points, the speaker actually criticizes the proposal for not going far enough. This shows alignment with the general idea but a desire for more aggressive measures.

> Beyond simply adding homes, the proposal has other positive impacts, such as the way that Town Center is zoning, will support small businesses that provide so much to our neighborhoods.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote briefly mentions Town Center zoning and its support for small businesses, which aligns with the reference talking points on this topic, though it doesn't go into as much detail.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, often making similar claims and arguments, particularly regarding lifting parking mandates and the need for more housing, including affordable housing. The speaker supports the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal and discusses several key elements that align with the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking mandates, transit-oriented development, and Town Center zoning.

However, the testimony doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference talking points (e.g., ADUs, office-to-residential conversions, shared housing/SROs), and in some cases, like transit-oriented development, the speaker suggests that the proposal doesn't go far enough. This indicates that while there is strong alignment, it's not a perfect match to the reference talking points.

The language used is not identical to the reference talking points, suggesting that the speaker is not directly reading from them but rather expressing similar ideas in their own words. This lends authenticity to the testimony while still aligning closely with the organization's key messages.

### Quotes


> We are strongly in support of removing removing the minimum parking requirements for new residential developments citywide to allow for more housing options and hopefully getting to lower construction costs.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the talking point about lifting parking minimums. It uses similar language and reasoning, mentioning both increased housing options and lower costs.

> We want to support the revision of the height limitation rules in the downtown Brooklyn special district, specifically. Certain areas along Livingston Skimmerhorn Street And Flap Bush Avenue were identified in the proposal before you to have restrictive zoning envelopes and we support eliminating the height limits on Livingston, the north side of Skirma Horn and the 400 foot. Restriction along Flatbush Avenue Extension to encourage more housing.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly match any specific talking point, it supports the general idea of increasing housing density in transit-rich areas, which aligns with the Transit-Oriented Development concept.

> In terms of office to residential conversion, the average office vacancy rate

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote begins to address office-to-residential conversion, which is one of the reference talking points. However, the speaker ran out of time and couldn't elaborate, so the alignment is tenuous.


### Analysis
The testimony shows some alignment with the reference talking points, particularly regarding the removal of parking minimums. The speaker, Regina Myer, explicitly supports this policy change, using similar reasoning to the reference talking points (allowing for more housing options and lower construction costs). 

There's also some alignment with the general concept of increasing housing density, particularly in areas well-served by transit. While the speaker doesn't use the term "Transit-Oriented Development," her support for revising height limitations in Downtown Brooklyn to encourage more housing aligns with this concept.

The speaker briefly mentions office-to-residential conversion, which is one of the reference talking points, but doesn't have time to elaborate on it.

However, the testimony doesn't touch on several key points from the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, "Town Center" Zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, or Shared Housing (SROs). 

Overall, while there's strong alignment on some points, particularly parking minimums, the testimony doesn't cover the full range of topics in the reference talking points.

### Quotes


> To us, a big part of the solution is to change the scale and that's what the city of yes will allow.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the City of Yes proposal and aligns with the UAP talking point about allowing extra floor area for affordable housing. It supports the idea of changing zoning to allow for larger buildings.

> For example, to construct an apartment building of 50 units cost a lot more per unit than constructing a building of 75 units.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote supports the UAP talking point about denser buildings being worth it to get new affordable housing. It explains the economic rationale behind allowing larger buildings.

> So the simple math is you construct a larger building, you spend less per unit, you charge less rent.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly supports the idea behind the UAP, explaining how larger buildings can lead to more affordable housing. It aligns closely with the talking point about denser buildings being beneficial for affordability.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP). While it doesn't cover all the points mentioned in the reference talking points, it strongly supports the core idea of allowing larger, denser buildings to create more affordable housing. The speaker, an architect specializing in affordable housing, provides professional insight into how zoning changes allowing for larger buildings can lead to more cost-effective and affordable housing construction. This aligns well with the UAP's emphasis on extra floor area for affordable housing and the benefits of slightly denser buildings. The testimony doesn't contradict any of the reference talking points and provides additional economic reasoning to support the proposed changes.

### Quotes


> CityVS is a generational proposal that presents the opportunity to realize critical reforms within New York City's zoning code.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote aligns with the overall message of the reference talking points, which present the City of Yes proposal as a significant reform to address housing issues. While it doesn't match any specific talking point verbatim, it supports the general argument for zoning changes.

> As will be borne out under critical proposals like the university affordable universal affordability preference, which has the opportunity to realize truly generational and transformative effects, specifically within community board 3.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly references the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) mentioned in the talking points. The speaker's description of it as 'generational and transformative' closely aligns with the talking points' emphasis on UAP as a 'great step forward' for more housing and affordable housing.

> The prospect of a truly city wide proposal, one that sees the burdens and may I make clear the benefits of new housing production equally distributed across the city in a way that has not been possible since the misguided adoption of the mid century urban rural era 1961 zoning code.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** While this quote doesn't directly match any single talking point, it supports the overall message of the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and 'Town Center' Zoning points. It emphasizes the need for citywide housing production and zoning reform, which aligns with the goals of these talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows a significant alignment with the reference talking points, particularly in its strong support for the City of Yes proposal and its emphasis on the need for more housing and affordable housing across the city. The speaker directly mentions the Universal Affordability Preference, which is one of the key talking points provided.

While the testimony doesn't cover all the specific points mentioned in the reference (such as parking minimums, ADUs, or office-to-residential conversions), it strongly aligns with the overall message and goals of the talking points. The speaker's emphasis on citywide zoning reform and equal distribution of housing production indirectly supports many of the other talking points, even if they're not explicitly mentioned.

The language used by the speaker, describing the proposal as "generational" and emphasizing its transformative potential, closely mirrors the tone and messaging of the reference talking points. This suggests that the speaker may be familiar with or influenced by similar messaging strategies.

However, it's worth noting that the testimony is more personal and emotionally charged than the reference talking points, as the speaker expresses personal concerns about their future in the city due to housing issues. This personal touch adds authenticity to the testimony while still aligning with the core messages of the talking points.

### Quotes


> Want to talk about the dropping of parking requirements is something I'd probably support, both from a trended perspective and from a housing perspective. As I think other people have mentioned, it costs $67,000, I believe, with the estimate. It's built apart from vitamin Hannon, but it's astronomical. And surely does. Both prevent housing from being built and increase the cost of housing that is built. And parking mandates require people to pay for housing or taking parking that they're not even using.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** IDENTICAL_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote directly addresses the issue of parking requirements and closely aligns with the reference talking points on Lifting Parking Minimums. The speaker mentions the exact cost ($67,000) stated in the talking points and echoes the arguments about increased housing costs and forcing people to pay for unused parking.

> Another call too that I think is. I wanna call out is UAP, which I believe is I I will honestly, I think it is a very nuanced way to get some more affordable housing in large parts of the city. They call the high density districts. I as a I am on the Manhattan Community Board board. I do not speak to the board. Not to be for the board right now. But I was very impressed with the presentation on UNT. Connecticut before has a lot of special districts. And the application UIT to the special districts. You preserve the concept of the special districts and and reflected them while still allowing for that additional 20% density on what would have otherwise been allowed and get us that marginal affordable housing.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote discusses the UAP program and supports its implementation. While it doesn't use the exact language from the reference talking points, it does align with the general idea of providing extra floor area for affordable housing. The speaker's mention of 20% additional density is not explicitly stated in the reference points but supports the overall concept.


### Analysis
The testimony is closely related to the reference talking points, particularly on the topics of lifting parking minimums and the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) program. The speaker directly echoes some of the key arguments and even cites specific figures from the reference talking points, especially regarding parking costs. While the testimony doesn't cover all the topics mentioned in the reference talking points, the ones it does address are discussed in a manner that closely aligns with the provided arguments. The speaker's support for these initiatives and the similarity in reasoning suggest a high level of alignment with the reference talking points, even if the exact language used is not identical.

### Quotes


> On the city of yes for housing opportunity, I'm in favor.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote shows general support for the proposal, which aligns with the overall sentiment of the reference talking points. However, it doesn't reference any specific talking point.

> City of Yes is a text amendment. Not a developer specific project seeking Uler approval. Thus, not every possible new building that would be allowed by city of yes will be built, not in immediately, and in many cases, not ever, current property owners would retain control of whether to sell or whether to build themselves.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote explains the nature of the proposal as a text amendment, which is not directly mentioned in the reference talking points. However, it indirectly supports the idea of creating more opportunities for housing development, which is a theme in several of the talking points.


### Analysis
The testimony shows support for the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, which aligns with the general sentiment of the reference talking points. However, the testimony doesn't directly address or closely echo any of the specific talking points provided. Instead, it focuses on the potential impact on local communities and suggests modifications to the proposal, such as including caps on new development.

The testimony doesn't mention key aspects of the reference talking points such as Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, Office-to-Residential conversions, or Shared Housing. 

While the testimony is generally supportive of increasing housing opportunities, it takes a more cautious approach, acknowledging potential concerns about the pace and scale of development. This differs from the more enthusiastic and specific endorsements found in the reference talking points.

Given these observations, the testimony cannot be classified as having high alignment or directly supporting the specific talking points provided. The alignment is more general and conceptual rather than specific.

### Quotes

No quotes found.

### Analysis
The testimony provided by David West does not closely align with the reference talking points. While the speaker expresses general support for the zoning changes and mentions increased housing production, which is a theme in some of the reference talking points, the testimony focuses on specific architectural and design aspects of the proposed changes. The speaker's concerns are more technical in nature, discussing issues like setbacks, street walls, and building design flexibility.

The reference talking points cover broader policy issues such as affordability, parking minimums, transit-oriented development, and various types of zoning changes. None of these specific points are directly addressed in the testimony.

Given the lack of direct references or similarities to the provided talking points, it appears that the testimony is not closely related to the reference talking points.

> My colleagues will speak about the need to protect investments in producing affordable housing under today's Incrutable housing program.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** TENUOUS_LINK
- **Analysis:** This quote briefly mentions affordable housing, which could be related to the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP) talking point. However, the connection is tenuous as it doesn't directly address the specific points mentioned in the UAP talking point. The focus here seems to be on protecting existing investments rather than promoting new affordable housing initiatives.


### Analysis
The testimony is primarily focused on proposing vesting provisions for the "City of YES for housing opportunities" zoning change. While this topic is related to zoning and housing, it doesn't closely align with the specific talking points provided in the reference document. The testimony briefly mentions affordable housing, but doesn't elaborate on it in a way that clearly supports the reference talking points. The majority of the testimony discusses technical aspects of vesting rights and timelines, which are not addressed in the provided talking points. Given this analysis, the testimony does not appear to be closely aligned with the reference talking points.

> I support the overall goals of housing opportunity and applaud the effort to generate more affordable housing expand opportunities for office conversions, and advance numerous changes which can facilitate building in New York.

- **Closeness to Reference Talking Point:** SUPPORTS_POINT
- **Analysis:** This quote generally supports the goals of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity proposal, which aligns with the overall theme of the reference talking points. However, it doesn't make any specific claims that match the talking points exactly.


### Analysis
The testimony is only loosely related to the reference talking points. While the speaker expresses support for the overall goals of housing opportunity and affordable housing, which aligns with the general theme of the reference talking points, the majority of the testimony focuses on specific zoning issues in Midtown and Lower Manhattan that are not directly addressed in the provided talking points.

The testimony lacks mention of key points from the reference talking points such as Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, transit-oriented development, town center zoning, ADUs, office-to-residential conversions, and shared housing. Instead, it focuses on critiquing specific proposed changes to zoning regulations in certain districts.

The only significant overlap between the testimony and the reference talking points is the general support for increasing housing opportunities and affordable housing. However, even this alignment is limited, as the speaker's specific recommendations and concerns are not reflected in the provided talking points.

Given these observations, the testimony cannot be classified as having high alignment or strongly supporting the reference talking points. While there is some general support for similar goals, the specific focus and recommendations of the testimony diverge significantly from the provided talking points.

### Quotes

No quotes found.

### Analysis
The testimony is not closely related to the reference talking points provided. While the speaker, Brian Shrout, expresses support for the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, his focus is entirely on the Landmark Transfer mechanism, which is not mentioned in the reference talking points. 

The speaker's argument for more flexibility in transferring development rights from landmark buildings aligns with the general spirit of increasing housing opportunities and zoning flexibility. However, this specific mechanism is not one of the main points outlined in the provided talking points.

The testimony does not discuss any of the key issues mentioned in the reference talking points, such as Universal Affordability Preference, lifting parking minimums, Transit-Oriented Development, "Town Center" zoning, Accessory Dwelling Units, office-to-residential conversions, or shared housing/SROs.

Given the lack of direct correlation between the testimony and the provided talking points, it would be inaccurate to classify this as having high alignment or even supporting the specific talking points. The testimony is focused on a different aspect of zoning reform that, while potentially related to the broader goals of the "City of Yes for Housing Opportunity" proposal, is not directly addressed in the given talking points.
